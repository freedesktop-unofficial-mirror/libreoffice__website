<h1>The even quicker hackers' CWS howto</h1>
<p>
  For a lengthier cws explanation see <a href="cws-quickhowto.txt">here</a>.
This text, is some really, really bare bones for the quickest, most simple
cws usage; all fields that you'll need to change are italic for ease.
</p>
<p>
  The basic overview here is that a CWS is a CVS branch, tied to a
database called <a href="http://eis.services.openoffice.org/EIS2/servlet/GuestLogon">
EIS</a>. The <code>cws*</code> tooling talks to both the CVS server
and (via SOAP) to the database. It makes maintaining branches more
efficient, standardises their use &amp; integrates with QA nicely.
</p>

<h3>Basic setup / Assumptions</h3>
<p>
  It is assumed that you have fixed some bug / created some feature,
and you have a live build tree in <i>/opt/OpenOffice/src680-m76</i>.
It is also assumed that you have sourced the LinuxIntelEnv.Set.sh
script and have you shell setup right.
</p>
<p>
  It is also assumed that you have an up-stream OO.o cvs account,
and that you have your tunnel setup correctly, and the source has
the right CVS/Root entries for that account/tunnel.
</p>

<h3>Creating the cws</h3>
<p>
  You have to think of an imaginative name for your cws; if it's just
some general bug fixing thing, people tend to use
account-name&lt;index&gt; otherwise some more descriptive name
</p>
<p>
  <code>
    cwscreate <b>-f</b> SRC680 <i>m76</i> <i>link01</i>
  </code>
</p>
<p>
  NB. the -f stops cwscreate doing a slow, monstor fresh
  check-out (you don't want that).
</p>
<p>
  NB. cwscreate in this mode: SOAP only, no CVS access.
</p>
</body>

<h3>Setting up the environment</h3>
<p>
  Now we created a cws - we need to tell the tooling we're
working with this cws; we do:
</p>
<p>
  <code>
    export CWS_WORK_STAMP=<i>link01</i>
  </code>
</p>

<h3>Adding tasks</h3>
<p>
  The CWS (in order to ever get merged) has to have a number of
issues associated with it, describing the bugs fixed in this CWS.
The developer should mark these as 'Fixed' as he commits/tests
&amp; QA should mark these bugs 'Verified'. It's also important to
get the Milestone correct in the bug. To associate the task with
the cws do:
</p>
<p>
  <code>
    cwsaddtask <i>i24253</i>
  </code>
</p>
<p>
  NB. cwsaddtask: SOAP only, no CVS access.
</p>

<h3>Adding modules</h3>
<p>
  We now need to add some top-level modules to the CWS - the
ones that we have changed. This tool essentially just tags cvs
twice with a static: CWS_SRC680_<i>LINK01</i>_ANCHOR tag and
a cws_src680_<i>link01</i> branch tag to commit to. It then
updates the module to that branch.
</p>
<p>
  <code>
    cwsadd -a <b>-f</b> <i>solenv</i>
  </code>
</p>
<p>
  NB. here -f allows you to keep your changes, while doing the
tagging on the underlying versions they are based on -
incorporating them into the new cws automatically.
</p>
<p>
  NB. cwsadd: SOAP and CVS access.
</p>

<h3>Committing code</h3>
<p>
  Committing requires nothing particular new; the database
doesn't track commits. Just commit them to the branched
modules you cwsadded.
</p>

<h3>When you're happy</h3>
<p>
  Finally - when you've committed everything &amp; tested it,
and/or if you're strange &amp; like to have a long-term cws open
you need to setup your cws details in
<a href="http://eis.services.openoffice.org/EIS2/servlet/GuestLogon">
EIS</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Login with your SourceCast account details (log out first).
Navigate the SRC680 'new' tree - find your cws, and click on
the underlined link at the top. Fill out all the details,
dates in the format <b>2005-08-02</b>.
</p>
<p>
  Having done all that, go-back, and re-edit the details -
marking the state to 'Ready for QA' [ you did mark all your
bugs 'FIXED' first ? - don't run foul of the thought police ].
</p>

<h3>What next ?</h3>
<p>
  You get to wait until the CWS is nominated by Sun QA up-stream,
then it will (eventually) be merged into HEAD and released.
