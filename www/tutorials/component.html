Now that we have our component built and ready, we are ready to invoke it from
elsewhere, and we do exactly that from the same earlier location:

     String aStr = aShowText.GetText();
 
     if ( !aStr.Len() )

By invoking the global service factory to create an instance of our new
component for us, we pass it the name of the service that we want to use and
ask it to create one instance of it for us.

Which of course fails :-) so what does happen is the printing of the error
message that it is unable to instantiate xHelloWorld.

While the component is built and ready, what happens is that all components
are registered into the central registry which specifies the complete list of
components available and where their implementations lie, which is in
$OOoInstall/program/services.rdb. Which is where the ServiceManager goes in to
look for our service and turns up blank because it is definitely not aware of
our component and therefore the query for our service fails. 

Enter regview and regcomp :-) regview is the registry viewer that is built in
registry/ and copied over to the solver, so the path to regview goes:
solver/680/unxlngi4.pro/bin/regview. This is of course unnecessary if
LinuxIntelEnvSet.sh is sourced, since that places the solver's bin/ directory
in the $PATH.

So if we shift over to the $OOoInstall/program directory and issue:

regview services.rdb | less

we would see the entire list of services and their implementations and
checking for 'helloWorld' would confirm that our library is not registered
within.

What we therefore need to do is register our component implemented by our so
into this registry, so we go:

regcomp -register -r services.rdb -c libhworld680li.so

[ This is assuming that we have either copied over our library from the build
tree or even better, as the Hacker's Guide describes, linked in our library
into the build tree so that it is accessible/hackable from the installation. ]

and do a regview to check for the 'helloWorld' entry and success! :-) The
entry should look similar to: 

Registry "file:///home/raul/opt/m110/program/services.rdb":

/
 / IMPLEMENTATIONS
...
...
...
   / org.openoffice.world.hello
     / UNO
       / ACTIVATOR
         Value: Type = RG_VALUETYPE_STRING
                Size = 34
                Data = "com.sun.star.loader.SharedLibrary"
 
       / SERVICES
         / org.openoffice.helloWorld
       / LOCATION
         Value: Type = RG_VALUETYPE_STRING
                Size = 18
                Data = "libhworld680li.so"
...
...
...
 / SERVICES
...
...
...
   / org.openoffice.helloWorld
     Value: Type = RG_VALUETYPE_STRINGLIST
            Size = 35
            Len  = 1
            Data = 0 = "org.openoffice.world.hello"

This time we run the code in charmap, the registry does have the entry
corresponding to our service and successfully returns the right service
implementation instance to execute() it! w00t! :-)

Similarly, regcomp -revoke -r services.rdb -c libhworld680li.so would remove
the registry entry and we'd get back our error message :-) Do note that
services.rdb is usually installed as read-only and it would probably be
necessary to change its permissions in order to write/register/revoke to the
registry. 

Which leaves us with one last thing to do, the automatic registration of the
component at installation time in addition to copying over as well, and the
existing infrastructure takes care of the entire magic for us with two changes
in the earlier entry we had:

And then, we're done, or are we now ? :-)
