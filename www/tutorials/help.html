<p>This is aimed to be a hack walk-through of OpenOffice.org, and as an
extension to the <a href="http://go-ooo.org/hackers-guide.html">Unofficial OpenOffice Hacker's Guide</a>.

<p>The tutorials are so far meant to be in the order specified on the index page,
and sometimes may not make complete sense if not read in order. The focus has
largely been on content and not on formatting [obviously ;-)].

<p>This is the way a typical page of the tutorial is organized. The page has the
write-up on the hack that is being walked through; the patch containing the
complete hack is on the extreme bottom left of the page. And the link to the
next tutorial is on the extreme bottom right of the page.

<p>That apart, we can have a glossary of unusual terms here that can be easy to
refer back to.

<p>build tree: In ooo-build, the build/src-mxx/ directory which contains the
complete source of OpenOffice.org

<p>HEAD: OOo 2.0, as opposed to the earlier 1.1.3, as of Jan 2005

<p>top-level project: The build tree contains around 150 directories, each of
which are usually referred to as top-level projects. A good description of the
toplevel projects is available at <a href="http://de.openoffice.org/about-ooo/about-projects.html">http://de.openoffice.org/about-ooo/about-projects.html</a> in German. You can use a language
translator site to get it in English.
