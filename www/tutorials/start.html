Hack!                                                                     <a href="help.html">Help!</a>

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hack what ? We would have to start with what's available to hack first :-)

So let's see, launching OOo with the newly installed 'soffice' launches the
framework of the OpenOffice.org application. If it defaults to open with a
default document, just close the application so that we have the blank
framework window to start with.

Doesnt look very complicated, so we have a menubar at the top and one toolbar
below it. The help option in the menubar has as the last menuitem
"About OpenOffice.org" which is what we're going to target now:

Most of the functionality we are interested in is concentrated in relatively
few of the top-level projects -

sw - is the OpenOffice.org Writer
sc - is the OpenOffice.org Calc
sd - is the OpenOffice.org Impress and Draw

And where functionality is common for all these applications, it is usually
held in one of the desktop, svx and sfx2 projects.

The objective of this hack is to attach a keyboard accelerator to the About
Dialog, so similar to how Ctrl+N launches a New Document, we'll add in a Ctrl+T
to launch the About Dialog.

We want this to be accessible across all the applications, which is held in the
top-level svx project. svx/source/src/app.src lists the accelerators that are
common across all the applications and is the location where we'll start our
hack:

--- svx/source/src/app.src	2004-11-29 14:28:05.000000000 +0530
+++ svx/source/src/app.src	2004-12-20 21:54:16.895040960 +0530
@@ -178,6 +178,7 @@ ACC RID_DEFAULTACCEL
         ACC_CODE( SID_VIEW_DATA_SOURCE_BROWSER, KEY_F4, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE )
         ACC_CODE( SID_FM_GRABCONTROLFOCUS, KEY_F5, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE )
         ACC_CODE( SID_HANGUL_HANJA_CONVERSION, KEY_F7, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE )
+        ACC_CODE( SID_ABOUT, KEY_T, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE )
 	};
 };

Add in that single line, rebuild svx, and launch soffice with the blank
framework window. Hitting Ctrl+T should launch the About Dialog :-)

Now that's an interesting line which can be modified in a good number of ways,
so maybe you'd like to try out the variations and see what happens :-)

Go ahead!
