Hack up a client for our library!                                         <a href="help.html">Help!</a>

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The procedure is that each top-level project is built by compiling the source
into the unxlngi4.pro directory within that project. So what happens if you want
to initiate a fresh build of just one project, you can rm -rf unxlngi4.pro and
initiate a build again, but if the module is say sw, that means a long wait.
Typically we can just back up the build directory and re-build while looking for
errors.

The cute build procedure is even further organised that after the project is
'built' into unxlngi4.pro, the build results are copied over into the solver/
top-level project that holds the complete build results of OO.o. So if you were
looking just at the source, there would be no solver/ top-level directory, the
same way there would be no unxlngi4.pro/ directory in a top-level project if it
has not been built yet. Looking at it in terms of size, the size of the solver
directory is 435 MB on my machine...

This information helps us better understand how we can use our brand new library
from another top-level project. So let's go back to our earlier charmap
modification [or it could be any other project] and add in a couple of lines to
use the objects from our new library:

     String aStr = aShowText.GetText();

With that lines in, we try to 'build' and promptly halt :-)

Since the new project has no information about our new projects, it needs to be
informed of where it can find them which we do:

/home/raul/HEAD/ooo-build/build/src680-m65/svx/source/dialog/charmap.cxx:123:37: helloworld/helloworld.hxx: No such file or directory

So what happens in order to pick up header files is that two locations are
searched in - one is the project's own inc/ directory and the second is the
solver/inc/ directory. So in order that the helloworld.hxx file can be picked
up, it needs to be placed there first. The procedure to export such header files
is what the deliver tool does which is:

alias deliver='perl /home/raul/HEAD/ooo-build/build/src680-m65/solenv/bin/deliver.pl'

The deliver.pl takes as input the prj/d.lst which has been empty so far and
'delivers' the files indicated by the file into the solver directory which would
then be available to any other top-level projects in OO.o. So we add in one line
to d.lst:

+hedabu: ..\inc\helloworld.hxx %_DEST%\inc%_EXT%\helloworld\helloworld.hxx

This is supposed to indicate that the header file is to be copied over to the
solver/inc/ directory as the Hacker's Guide also indicates, and issue the
'deliver' command from the helloworld/ project:

deliver -- version: 1.77
COPY: build.lst -> /home/raul/HEAD/ooo-build/build/src680-m65/solver/680/unxlngi4.pro/inc/helloworld/build.lst

Statistics:
Files copied: 2
Files unchanged/not matching: 0

That looks like it did the job, so shift back to the svx/ project and 'build'
again and everything goes smoothly till:

Checking DLL ../unxlngi4.pro/lib/check_libsvx680li.so ...: ERROR: ../unxlngi4.pro/lib/check_libsvx680li.so: undefined symbol: _ZN5hello5world10HelloWorld5adiosEv

'---* tg_merge.mk *---'
 
ERROR: Error 65280 occurred while making /home/raul/HEAD/ooo-build/build/src680-m65/svx/util

So our library says it has an undefined symbol, the rather unhelpful
_ZN5hello5world10HelloWorld5adiosEv which 'c++filt' helpfully translates to the
more understandable: hello::world::HelloWorld::adios() So compilation has
succeeded but linking is failing to find the object code/our library in order to
link to it.

So what happens in the linking phase to create the end so is that the top-level
project has a util/makefile.mk which indicates which libraries it links against
that now needs to be updated to look for our library. If we look into it, we
find funny little acronyms sounding terms like SFX2LIB which obviously build
seems to understand, so it must be part of the solenv/ directory, so we go in
and poke there:

grep -rn SFX2LIB *

and promptly find solenv/inc/libs.mk which defines
SFX2LIB=-lsfx$(OFFICEUPD)$(DLLPOSTFIX) so we take the easy way out and modify
the makefile directly:

Grr... So the library is unavailable. Now what happens is that LD_LIBRARY_PATH
and PATH include the solver directories which is where the world-famous :-D
libhworld680li.so needs to be, in order to be picked up. And d.lst accomplishes
the same thing using one more line to copy them over:

Files unchanged/not matching: 2

And the library is copied over into the solver directory. In the top-level make
or OOo build procedure, build and deliver are invoked in each project which
ensures that the libraries built previously are available for the projects built
later.

With that, we go back to svx and 'build':

Checking DLL ../unxlngi4.pro/lib/check_libsvx680li.so ...: ok

Making: ../unxlngi4.pro/lib/svx.lib

Yes! :-) Our new library is linked and ready for action! There are two potential
problems here, the first one being that the library being linked to being in
the path that the linker looks in for the first stage where the linking is done.
The second is that Checking DLL .. is the checkdll.sh which loads the newly
generated library which in turn tries to load up the library linked to as well.
So if the library being linked to is some odd location with the linker given to
the path to it, the same path needs to be in the LD_LIBARY_PATH as well so that
it can be loaded up in the next step.

So we launch soffice to execute our new code path/library and ka-boom! It
crashes :-( That's because we have our new library linked in, but the OOo
installation from which we run soffice is not aware of it at all whatsoever.
Trying out 'ldd soffice.bin' or 'ldd libsvx680li.so' will show up the new
library as not found.

There are two ways to fix this up, we could include LD_LIBRARY_PATH to look
for our new library, or we could copy it over into the installation as well.
Whichever way, we are done and can see our "Hello, World!" intact :-) That is
one entertaining hello world program now, ain't it ? :-)

And are we done yet ? :-) Nope :-) We have one last thing - instead of copying
over the library, it would be a lot cooler if we could include it in the
installation so that it can take care of ensuring that our library is present
when it runs, and then we can link that library to our build area to continue
our hacking as the Hacker's Guide lays it out. So let's do just that :-)

The packaging of the OOo files is done in the top-level scp2/ project which
specifies which files to package and what treatment they require in a long list
of scp files. What we do is the usual - we look for a promising suspect and
clone it :-D So we do:

--- scp2/source/ooo/file_library_ooo.scp	2004-12-21 14:49:11.000000000 +0530
+++ scp2/source/ooo/file_library_ooo.scp	2004-12-24 10:11:44.343252931 +0530

And this time we know how it works. So after we do a 'build' in the directory,
we do a 'deliver' so that the solver/ directory is updated with the new list
of files to package. And this time, we run the installation, we'll have the
library installed as well :-)

As for making the new helloworld/ project built as part of the rest of the
projects, we just need to make the postprocess/ top-level project dependent on
this project being built by adding the project name to the long list of projects
that it is dependent on and the build procedure will take care of it. phew! :-)

[ Joerg Barfurth corrects: If you are using your library in svx, then the proper
way to make it part of the global build is of course to add it to the 
dependencies of svx (in svx/prj/build.lst). Only if the output of your new
module is not used by any other module at build time (i.e does not export
headers or import libraries, for example e.g. if it only creates a UNO
component) then postprocess/ is the one to use. ]

And then, we are done! :-)
