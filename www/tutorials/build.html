<p>ah! :-) Build svx, build sfx2, build sw, build sd ?!! Time out! What is this 
build ?

<p>Good question :-) So let's examine it in detail, let's first ask the guy
directly first: Issuing 'which build' at the command line returns nothing :-) A
second try with 'alias build' starts to explain what's happening:

<p>alias build='perl /home/raul/ooo-build/build/src680-m65/solenv/bin/build.pl'

<p>hmm... So how did we get this alias set at all ? From sourcing the
LinuxIntelEnvSet.sh which does exactly what the name of the file says: It sets
the environment for the Linux build of OOo on the Intel platform - so that
helps to understand the other SolarisSparcEnvSet.sh as well.

<p>Of what I understand, this file is the end result of the configure process of
OOo which is then used for the build process throughout. You can look into the
file itself to check what else is in it.

<p>So build is the perl script which is in the top-level solenv project [probably
a derivation from Solaris environment] which has most of the build tools in it.

<p>And how does it work ? Let's learn it in the coolest way possible :-) Let's add
a top-level project to OOo :-)

<p>We shall with great imagination and creativity call our cool new top-level
project as *drum-roll* 'helloworld'! So we start at the top of the build tree
with a 'mkdir helloworld' and cd into it [So the path to our project now would
typically be similar to '/home/raul/ooo-build/build/src680-m65/helloworld' and
all further references to our project will simply be referred to in short as 
helloworld/dir-name/file-name]

<p>Now let's try to build our new project [already! with nothing in it :-)] by
issuing 'build'. oops! In fact, of course, OOPS! :-)

<pre>
build -- version: 1.130

ERROR: Found no project to build
</pre>

<p>hmm... That presents a problem indeed, we do have a project, don't we now ? :-)
so let's see where this error is coming up in the first place and then we'll
look into fixing them, so first we move into the solenv/ top-level project which
as we had mentioned earlier has most of the build tools and where we suspect the
source of this error lies as well.

<p>And we go on to grep for the error message through the source with either of a:

<pre>
grep -rn "no project to build" *
find solenv/ -exec grep -Hn "no project to build" {} \;
</pre>

<p>and lo! the source is bin/build.pl, so let's look in the source to see what the
problem might be and we see that the build.pl script is looking for a build.lst
file in the prj directory and fails otherwise. aha! :-) So we
'touch prj/build.lst' and 'build' again.

<pre>
build -- version: 1.130
</pre>

<p>hmm... That's not interesting at all, so let's poke it more - our purpose is to
actually make a library which we can eventually link to - so let's do just that
and we take the shortest route to our goal. We look for someone else who
does the same thing and do a similar thing. As the saying goes: "Good artists
copy, great artists steal!" Amen! :-)

<p>So we get inspired from the XmlSearch/prj/build.lst and make up our very own
impressive looking build.lst as well:

<pre>

+hw     helloworld\source               nmake   -       all     hw_src  NULL
</pre>

<p>It's a fairly simple file that is explained a little more in the Hacker's Guide
as well. The first line indicates that it is not dependent on any of the other
top-level projects and if it was - the line would be similar to the XmlSearch/
file which indicates that it is dependent on the external/ and codemaker/
projects, which is to say that those projects need to be built before this one
can be built.

<p>The second line goes on to indicate what is to be built in the present top-level
project and in what order. Our simple line says that the helloworld/source
directory will be what is built and since it is particularly simple, there are
no other internal build order as might be required in a more complicated
projects [fpicker, for instance].

<p>And yay! we have already told our build.pl what needs to be done, so lets do
the 'build' thing again:

<pre>
build -- version: 1.130

ERROR: /home/raul/HEAD/ooo-build/build/src680-m65/helloworld/source not found!!
</pre>

<p>That's ok, we can fix that, we havent created the source directory where we
intend to place the source that will be built into our library. So we
'mkdir source' and 'build' again:

<pre>
build -- version: 1.130

/home/raul/HEAD/ooo-build/build/src680-m65/helloworld/source
mkout -- version: 1.3
mkout: ERROR: can't determine module
../unxlngi4.pro/inc/myworld.mk: No such file or directory.
../unxlngi4.pro/misc/s_helloworld.dpcc: No such file or directory.
dmake:  Error code 1, while making '../unxlngi4.pro/misc/s_helloworld.dpcc'
'---* TG_SLO.MK *---'

ERROR: Error 65280 occurred while making /home/raul/HEAD/ooo-build/build/src680-m65/helloworld/source
</pre>

<p>yeow! That sounded like an impressive sounding error! Back to square one, we go
back to the solenv/ project and grep for the ERROR:

<pre>
grep "can't determine module" -rn *
</pre>

<p>We would suspect from the error that it is evidently from the mkout.pl and look
in for clues, and we see that it is looking for a prj/d.lst which is definitely
not in our project yet, so we do a 'touch prj/d.lst' and 'build' again:

<pre>
build -- version: 1.130

/home/raul/HEAD/ooo-build/build/src680-m65/helloworld/source
-----------------------------------------------
Error: No makefile.mk found!
-----------------------------------------------
</pre>

<p>Yo! We are halfway there, the build script has reached our source directory and
would have built our project, if only there had been something to build :-) So
let's fix that next :-)
