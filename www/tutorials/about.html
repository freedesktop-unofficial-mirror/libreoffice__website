Hack the Dialog!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, I seem to love the About Dialog so much, so let's go poke the holy dialog
itself - so we already know that the dialog is common across all the
applications, so it would not be in their top-level projects, so it's probably
in one of the others.

And what do we search for ? The OOo code follows a pretty nice naming
convention, so you can guess that the About Dialog might just be named 'about',
which in fact it is. So doing a quick 'find -name *about*' in sfx2 returns a
set of results which also includes just the files we're interested in as well:
about.hxx, about.cxx, about.hrc and about.src.

This is the typical layout in OOo for most dialogs. There is a cxx file that
handles the dialog itself, which would most typically involve the declarations
being placed in a hxx file. The dialog's resources are typically in the src
file and the corresponding declarations in the hrc file. Cool! Let's hack! :-)

First poke around a little and see that it does a couple of things and has an
OK button, so let's keep the hack simple - we'll just add in a second OK
button to make ourselves happy :-) All it would involve is duplicating the
existing OK button to add in our new button and move it so it's visible. And
requires modifying only two of the files.
 
So first we add in the declaration in the header file:

--- sfx2/inc/about.hxx	2004-01-06 21:46:50.000000000 +0530
+++ sfx2/inc/about.hxx	2004-12-20 22:02:49.222155400 +0530

 {
 private:
 	OKButton    	aOKButton;
+	OKButton    	aOKSureButton;
 	Image			aAppLogo;
 
 	FixedInfo   	aVersionText;

Then we initialize it the same way the other button is initialized:

--- sfx2/source/dialog/about.cxx	2004-12-07 18:51:37.000000000 +0530

After which we add it into the dialog:

+
 	nY = aOKPnt.Y() + aOKSiz.Height() + a6Size.Height();
 	aOutSiz.Height() = nY;
 	SetOutputSizePixel( aOutSiz );

With that, we're ready to go! Rebuild sfx2 and launch soffice and you can
launch the About Dialog either with the Ctrl+T or the toolbar icon, and presto!
We have the new OK button :-)

Doesnt really do much though. You can fiddle around with the different options
and see what happens in each case.

But this is one way the dialogs could be drawn up, the other way - as is done
in a lot of the other dialogs - is where the dialog structure is in the src
files and not done programmatically as it's done here.
