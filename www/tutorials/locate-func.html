-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Assumptions :-) we have an installation in /opt/ooinstall/ which we link
to a build tree in ~/ooo-build/build/*680*/ and when run this creates a user
configuration dataset in ~/.ooo-2.0*

Another way to look for code is to start from the functionality that it
affects. For instance, you want to figure out where spell checking is being
done, so the first thing is to disable it from the UI to change the state of
the functionality. What we take advantage of is the fact that OOo stores the
configuration settings in our home directory which we can monitor.

So first we back up our existing configuration with a:

cp -a ~/.ooo-2.0 ~/.ooo-2.0.orig

and then change the state of the functionality we're looking for, in this
case: Tools->Options->Lanuguage Settings->Writing Aids and uncheck "Check
spelling as you type" and OK the dialog.

Once done, we do a recursive diff of the original and currect settings:

diff -upr ~/.ooo-2.0.orig ~/.ooo-2.0:
--- .ooo-2.0-pre.orig/user/registry/data/org/openoffice/Office/Linguistic.xcu	2005-10-18 19:55:24 +0530
+++ .ooo-2.0-pre/user/registry/data/org/openoffice/Office/Linguistic.xcu	2005-10-18 21:40:51 +0530

+  <prop oor:name="IsSpellAuto" oor:type="xs:boolean">
+   <value>false</value>
+  </prop>
+ </node>
 </oor:component-data>

and ignore the rest and go looking for this setting, in this case it is easier
to use LXR at go-oo.org and type in the text you're searching for
"IsSpellAuto". More specifically, using the text search and specifying to
search cxx files for the text IsSpellAuto, 

http://go-oo.org/lxr/search?filestring=cxx&string=IsSpellAuto

or even better:

http://go-oo.org/lxr/search?filestring=cxx&string=SpellChecking/IsSpellAuto

which gives us exactly one result [ lucky hit :-) ] at
svtools/source/config/lingucfg.cxx, so we look in for the corresponding
header file lingucfg.hxx since it has lesser code to read :-) and that gives
us the class to look for - SvtLinguOptions, which we now look to find in sw/

Since what usually happens is that the configuration data is read by the code
in svtools/ and fed into a structure, which is in turn invoked by different
applications as and when they need it. So we can expect to find this class
being invoked from the module we're interested in:

find sw/ -name "*.cxx" -exec grep -Hn SvtLinguOptions {} \;

or for the specific field we are interested in:

find sw/ -name "*.cxx" -exec grep -Hn IsSpellAuto {} \;

and find that this goes into a:

sw/source/ui/uiview/view.cxx:975:    aUsrPref.SetOnlineSpell(
aLinguOpt.bIsSpellAuto );

which promptly gives us the hint to do a grep for:

find sw/ -name "*.cxx" -exec grep -Hn OnlineSpell {} \;

and we see how the different areas invoke this option as they proceed... Not
simple for sure, but still quite intriguing... :-)
