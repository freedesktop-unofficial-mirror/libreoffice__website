Norwegian project has been administered and financed mainly by counties and
municipalities, but recently the foundation has started a process for getting
commercial companies more actively involved. We realise the need for a more
substantial commercial participation to establish a long-term sustainable project.<br>
Our foundation notes that the other Nordic countries, a majority of the European
countries, as well as a range of worldwide big companies like Google, Novell,
Canonical and Red Hat are now cooperating with The Document Foundation. We
believe this is the right way forward also for Norway.<br>
A cooperation with The Document Foundation will make it easier to create more
innovative and user-friendly solutions integrated with the LibreOffice suite.
Eliminating license barriers and obtaining easy access to source code and
standards will facilitate further development of related and integrated
