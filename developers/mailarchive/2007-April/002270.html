</I>Which version of which distrib should be best? I really interested in 
universal OOo packages that utilize the latest innovations of OOo like 
GNOME VFS, Quick Starter... As I wrote I used Ubuntu 7.04 (my main 
machine) should I force older version of glibc/Xfree, or I have to build 
another build machine based on older distribs like Debain 3.1r6 (or 4?) 
or other? Are there detailed information about them most compatible 
versions? tools.openoffice.org? or at the wiki?

Rail's hint:
&quot;Can you rerun with the following command:
strace -o /tmp/strace.txt -fF /path/to/soffice -writer

you need -f and -F to follow forks and threads.

I think the error comes from modular X.org which comes with dynamic
libxau (which was static before). Search for &quot;libxau&quot; or &quot;xau&quot; in strace
output.

I had such problem before. Switching to elder X.org/XFree solved &quot;no
suitable windowing system&quot; for me. My build machine runs Debian Sarge
which comes with XFree 4.3. Unfortunately it breaks some other optional
things like GTK+ file picker, GNOME VFS, Quick Starter (which also GTK+
program), KDE file picker...
&quot;
and
&quot;
Probably Linux from scratch with old glibc, old XFree and new
KDE/GNOME/GTK+ stuff. BTW, you can try --enable-static-gtk to link GTK
stuff static.
&quot;
 &gt;From Jim:
&quot;Same on GNU/Linux SPARC, OOF680_m14 and not modified.

I build on debian and a user reports this problem on an older debian 
system using kde.

Searching google suggests a variety of problems and fixes but I cannot 
see a consistent pattern or anything that works for my user. The message 
comes from here:
<A HREF="http://www.go-oo.org/lxr/source/gsl/vcl/unx/source/plugadapt/salplug.cxx#473">http://www.go-oo.org/lxr/source/gsl/vcl/unx/source/plugadapt/salplug.cxx#473</A> 


If you rebuild vcl with debug=t and drop the new lib into the installed 
OOo there will be some messages that might give a clue what goes wrong.
&quot;

and Kay from Sun:
&quot;
this error happens in case the to be used VCL plugin (KDE, GTK or plain 
X11) can not be loaded / instantiated. To break up the problem further, 
you may want to try to specify the to be used plugin explicitly in the 
environment:

 setenv SAL_USE_VCLPLUGIN &quot;kde&quot;

or

 setenv SAL_USE_VCLPLUGIN &quot;gtk&quot;

or

 setenv SAL_USE_VCLPLUGIN &quot;gen&quot;


At least &quot;gen&quot; should work always.

Please have a look at

<A HREF="http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Environment_Variables">http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Environment_Variables</A>

for other env. variables.
&quot;
&gt;<i>  Also do not forget to disable all the system stuff 
</I>&gt;<i> (try config_office/configure --help and check for --without-system-XXX).
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Is this working this way? I see just --with-system=XXX options not 
--without-system-XXX. What is the default? I expect the without system 
configuration...


&gt;<i> Note that distributions usually include compat packages with older libraries 
</I>&gt;<i> but not to the contrary.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You might also try the O3 Build CD, see 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/O3-build.">http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/O3-build.</A> It is based on the build 
</I>&gt;<i> environment used by Sun. I tested only the first version and had some 
</I>&gt;<i> problems with it. I am not sure if it is already usable...
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I didn't tty it before, but interesting attempt. I had a good machine 
based on debian, but that virtual machine has gone. The new VMWare 
machine identied Debian 4 and Ubuntu 7.04 as old system with anicient 
GLIBC (Pavel do you remember?) So I prepared my desktop machine as builder.
&gt;<i> Also Pavel Janik does universal builds, so he might help you.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I hope he has ideas about my problem. I observed his build machine, 
scipts, settings, etc. and he uses same configure settings - If I am 
right. My configure is here:
<A HREF="http://ooop.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/ooop/trunk/config_office/">http://ooop.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/ooop/trunk/config_office/</A>

It seems Windows versions works perfectly. Thank you guys for your work...



Thank you in advance,
KAMI
