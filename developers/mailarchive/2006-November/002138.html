<PRE>Hey list,

I just decided to post some update here since I just finished
committing fair amount of changes to the scsolver module that
addresses some important issues.

The following four issues are addressed in this round of change.

1) Handle window close event so that each dialog can be closed by
clicking the window manager's close button.  Incidentally, hitting the
escape key also closes the dialog with this change.

2) Reworked the code that parses constraint cells and converts them
into internal model.  The old code simply didn't do it right when a
left-hand-side (LHS) constraint cell contained a constant term in the
formula expression (e.g. =A1-B1*2+100 : A1 and B1 are both variable
cells).  It only worked when the expression contained no constant term
(e.g. =A1-B1*2).

3) While making change 2), I also made the parsing code flexible
enough so that even when the right-hand side constraint cell contains
one or more variable cells, it would convert correctly.  Previous code
always assumed that the RHS cell was constant.

4) When data is loaded from the document, and the user decides to
change one of its constraints immediately afterwards, the constraint
dialog failed to show the correct equality value in the first dialog
instance.  This is fixed.

4) A couple of crasher bugs fixed.

All of these changes are committed to the ooo-build-2-0-4 branch.
Please grab the code from that branch if this interests you.

Thanks,
Kohei
