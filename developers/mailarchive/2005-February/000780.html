<PRE>Hi!

- Been getting ooo-build m74 built on Windows - almost done, one last
thing left to check [hopefully :-)] ...
- Had been trying to get 1.1.4 built as well - that is somehow stuck
badly with the MS .sln in berkeleydb refusing to build the db.jar which
xmlhelp requires. Looking into what happened there, looks like the
upgrade of the berkeleydb source has left the project configuration
inconsistent with the makefile.mk.
- Finally figured out how the accelerators, menus, toolbars and status
bars can be modified in 2.0
   - From the user settings in ~/.openoffice.org... finally back to
svx. The user settings has the directory user/config/soffice.cfg which
has the xml files with all the resources specified in it. The user
settings are initially copied over from the installation directory. The
installation is generated from the uiconfig.zip file in
instsetoo_native. The uiconfig.zip is generated from the uiconfig/
directory in the solver tree by the postprocess/ project. The xml files
from the individual projects are delivered to the solver/ tree. [thanks
to Shreyas and Srini as well!] phew!

Regards,
Raul
