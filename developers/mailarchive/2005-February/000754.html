<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> 	Ark: you use --enable-libart instead of --without-gpc. I would
</I>&gt;<i> recommend using --without-gpc which uses an internal clipper instead of
</I>&gt;<i> GPC or an external libart. That is unless you know something I
</I>&gt;<i> don't ? :-) [ it'd be nice to share that option too ]
</I>
That was based on the configure output from config_office -- if --without-gpc 
is used, it screams that some features won't be available, if --enable-libart 
is used, it doesn't scream.

I don't know how accurate configure's reporting is -- if the scream is 
outdated or applies with --enable-libart too, then I definitely don't have a 
problem switching to --without-gpc.

&gt;<i> 	Ark: you don't build with libstartup-notification ? why not ?
</I>
&quot;No new packages during the freeze&quot; thing. We don't include 
libstartup-notification ATM and don't want to add a new package before the 
next release unless absolutely necessary.
Given that libstartup-notification doesn't provide any important functionality 
(KDE does a pretty good job at detecting it based on window opening -- we do 
get the wanted functionality in OOo even without libstartup-notification), 
this is hardly important enough to add a new package during the freeze.

An option here would be to remove all --{en,dis}able-libsn stuff from the 
configs and just autodetect it in config_office/configure.in by default -- 
that would allow common configs [everything omitted] while not breaking 
systems that don't have libsn.

&gt;<i> 	Debian/Ark - we added the --enable-gnome-vfs option to configure OO.o's
</I>&gt;<i> built-in Gnome-VFS support (which is now up-stream), it's prolly a good
</I>&gt;<i> thing to turn on for eg. <A HREF="smb:///">smb:///</A> share browsing.
</I>
This is a definite no for Ark. Being KDE only, we don't have gnome-vfs in our 
base installation, and we don't have all the stuff it depends on 
(libORBit-2.so.0, libORBitCosNaming-2.so.0, libbonobo-2.so.0, 
libbonobo-activation.so.4, libgconf-2.so.4) in the base installation either.

Our long term plan is to add KIO support which should give us the same 
features without bloating the base install by several MBs. We use a 1 
CD-setup for our base install, and we don't like the idea of switching to 
multi-CD - so every MB counts.

&gt;<i> NonArkCommon: Evo2
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	Which is rather ugly; I can understand the problems previously wrt.
</I>&gt;<i> different Evo. versions &amp; all that - but now (thanks to Jayant) this
</I>&gt;<i> code will compile without any evolution libraries / development packages
</I>&gt;<i> present &amp; will detect at runtime if it's available. So - any chance of
</I>&gt;<i> pruning that complexity back too ? :-)
</I>
Sure, as long as it doesn't require evo stuff at runtime or compile time.
This is the same as with gnome-vfs, we don't want to bloat the dependency list 
(our default mail/PIM suite is Kontact).
