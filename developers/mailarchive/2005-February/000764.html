<PRE>Hi folks

I have been looking at several bugs in 1.1.3 that ended up arising from the 
CUPS backport.  People have reported odd behaviour in various places, for 
example:

Stop CUPS server, start impress, new document, format-&gt;character, change tab, 
OOo crashes

or

Stop CUPS server, start impress, new doc, type some text, select 1 word, click 
on font colour toolbar icon, selection changes to whole word

I managed to trace this odd behaviour to bugs in the event handlers for 
SALEVENT_PRINTERCHANGED.  For example, the font dialog in impress never 
updates a pointer to the FontList that is deleted when the printer changes.  
The bugs are being brought to the surface because the CUPS hander is saying 
the printer queues have changed every time it is asked (such as when OOo gets 
a list of fonts) and those events are being triggered more often than would 
normally be expected.

It looks like the 2.0 codebase has had most of these bugs flushed out but I 
think 1.1.x is not stable enough to let this continue.  Therefore I am going 
to commit a patch to turn off dynamic queue updates, meaning OOo must be 
restarted to see new CUPS queues.

If anyone has the time to fix all the problems, I can collect &amp; provide a list 
of the symptoms people have reported.

Thanks
Chris
