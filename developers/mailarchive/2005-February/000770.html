<PRE>Hi,

today, I finally got a working build and packages of m76 after I found
out that the problem was in the packaging script that was apparently
untested for m76. Generalised the fix so that it doesn't break m74
builds and committed.

Also, pointed Shreyas, who wants to forward port zoom-combobox, to the
zoom combobox in sw's print preview.

Code reading: poked at cppu to see how bridges are loaded.

Bonsai'ed for cws_src644_cliuno01, the first cws with cliuno. There was
some code that might have been an attempt at a component loader for
managed code UNO components. Yesterday I noted in mono.txt that there is
no component loader for cli-uno. That code from the cws is not in HEAD.
Didn't look any closer here.

Mailed <A HREF="mailto:dev@udk">dev@udk</A> which (incidentally) had a recent thread wrt UNO+mono,
asked for some advice on where/how to make the native/managed split
which is only implicit in the current managed C++ CLI-UNO. Was told to
look at the JNI-based Java bridge. And my understanding of climaker was
confirmed (I think).

Next: have to read about .Net remoting, TransparentProxies, RealProxies
etc. and Mono embedding. And the Java bridge.

Regards,

Martin
