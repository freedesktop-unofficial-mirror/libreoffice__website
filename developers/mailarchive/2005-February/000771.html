<PRE>Hi Bernhard,

	Oh - that's just lying, I've added a patch to fix that.

	Great I've done that for you.

&gt;<i> &gt; 	Ark: you don't build with libstartup-notification ? why not ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;No new packages during the freeze&quot; thing.

	Fair enough.

&gt;<i> An option here would be to remove all --{en,dis}able-libsn stuff from the 
</I>&gt;<i> configs and just autodetect it in config_office/configure.in by default -- 
</I>&gt;<i> that would allow common configs [everything omitted] while not breaking

</I>
	I guess we could have a patch for that; indeed we really should be
trying to use more system-autodetection stuff at least by default in our
builds.

&gt;<i> &gt; 	Debian/Ark - we added the --enable-gnome-vfs option to configure OO.o's
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is a definite no for Ark. Being KDE only, we don't have gnome-vfs in our 
</I>&gt;<i> base installation, and we don't have all the stuff it depends on 
</I>
	Fair enough.

&gt;<i> &gt; NonArkCommon: Evo2
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sure, as long as it doesn't require evo stuff at runtime or compile time.
</I>&gt;<i> This is the same as with gnome-vfs, we don't want to bloat the dependency list 
</I>&gt;<i> (our default mail/PIM suite is Kontact).
</I>
	It requires only glib2 (gobject) to compile - you'd prolly be
hard-pressed to get that off your CD though - a number of apps use it -
do you have it ?

	Regards,

		Michael.
