<PRE>Hi,

Last week, brought visibility03 to a closure and resynced against m80 so
that mhu could take it further for win, solaris builds and subsequently
for QA.
Then moved over to bug hunting; It turns out of that quite few bugs that
we want to fix are already resolved in some or other cws which are not
integrated yet. Taking some of those relevant cws gets us some more of
the fixes that went into the cws along with the ones which we wanted fix
at a priority.
So, took presfixes01 and made a patch against ooo-build m79; that's a
huge patch coming close to 30k lines excluding the new files introduced
in there. Patched up the source and now onto build. Though huge, that
gets us around 20 bugs fixed. Lets see how the build goes.

Apart from that some misc stuff - patch reviews etc.

thanks,
-Nicel.
