<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE> - Added in the extra combo box for the file-picker
 - Added in the fix to let the check for allowing to open .txt file
with the Text/CSV filter but that is not working in m78 'gen' as well at
the moment
 - Added in the patch to make the default sw bullet larger and right
now, it looks too large :-)
 - Got 1.1.4 built on Win32, but the berkeleydb fix needs to be checked
in CVS yet. The db_java was not getting built because there was a quote
string in the command path, and ends up creating a blank and unusable
db.jar and not throwing up any error at all. [Also a change in
rsc-default-to-english.diff seems to have broken it, need to check.]
 - m74 is built on Win32, but needs to be verified against the changes
made since then.

Regards,
Raul
