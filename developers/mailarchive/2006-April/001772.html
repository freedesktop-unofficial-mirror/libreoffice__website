<PRE>Hi,

I know that I am a bit late but ...

Kendy, there is one question for you, close the end of the mail.

It started to work with recent gcj. At least, I expect that it was caused by 
gcj. There many problems caused by 
<A HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=13212">http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=13212</A>

I hope that the fix is in gcc-4.1 now. If not I could ask our gcc developers 
where they found the fix that we currently use.

&gt;<i> 2. The package splits are a bit odd in some cases. Shouldn't the
</I>&gt;<i>    dictionaries go to the language packs instead of core?
</I>
We (Novell) pack myspell-dictionaries in extra packages (one per language). 
Though, we put the hyphen and thesaurus dictionaries into the main OOo 
package. They are relatively small. The user could write documents in more 
languages even if it uses single UI localization.

&gt;<i> 3. The included media player doesn't work. Picking a sound from the gallery
</I>&gt;<i>    does nothing, opening it manually and trying to open any file results in
</I>&gt;<i>    &quot;The format of the selected file is not supported.&quot;
</I>
I have tested it about a year ago. Unfortunately, a Java extension, with a 
strange license, is necessary:

Here are the necessary steps to make it
work:

1. download JMF from:
   <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/jmf/2.1.1/download.html">http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/jmf/2.1.1/download.html</A>

   The cross-platform version is able to play simple formats, such as .wav,
.mov
   The Linux specific version is necessary for more complicated formats, such
as 
   .mpg

2. install/unpack JMF anywhere.

3. start ooffice

4. add jmf.jar to the classpath by:
   Tools/Options.../OpenOffice.org/Java/Class Path.../Add Archive...

5. quit OOo

6. start oowriter

  You must set LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/JMF-*/lib to enable also the Linux
  native modules (necessary for .mpg).

7. try to replay movies or sounds by Tools/Media Player

I hope that it is still valid.

&gt;<i> 4. I can't reproduce this one myself, but one tester (who generally isn't
</I>&gt;<i>    a crackpot) reported the Gallery feature doesn't include any OpenClipart
</I>&gt;<i>    stuff, even though it was built with OpenClipart enabled.
</I>&gt;<i>    Strangely enough, deleting gengal.rdb fixed it for him?!
</I>&gt;<i>    The same user mentioned it would be nice to add the system icons
</I>&gt;<i>    (KDE/Gnome/...) to the Gallery -- sounds like a good idea to me too.
</I>
I cannot reproduce it as well.

&gt;<i> 5. On a default install, Evolution is listed as a standard data source
</I>&gt;<i>    (even though it's not installed), but KDE AddressBook isn't.
</I>&gt;<i>    (While at it, neither are Mozilla and Thunderbird - may make sense to
</I>&gt;<i>    add those too).
</I>&gt;<i>    I'm not very familiar with the way OOO's database access works;
</I>&gt;<i>    does the attached fix (for the KDE AddressBook part) look right? If so,
</I>&gt;<i>    what's the best way to add it, given it has to add a binary file
</I>&gt;<i> (kab.odb)? 
</I>
I looks like a good idea. I think that it is worth to report it into bugzilla. 
Could you please do it?

Kendy, who could review the proposed KDE AddressBook fixes?

&gt;<i> 6. ooimpress crashes with signal 11 when exiting. Not critical 
</I>&gt;<i> because the user wanted to exit anyway, but not very nice either.
</I>
I am not able to reproduce it with the recent package (ooo-build-2.0.2.7).
