<PRE>Hi all,

I'm building OOo under Windows XP using the ooo-build structure, a fresh build.
Since it started with some difficulty, I'm reporting the actions, some
other could benefit I think.

The ChangeLog top is:

2006-07-14  Petr Mladek  &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/openoffice">pmladek at suse.cz</A>&gt;

	* Version 2.0.3.0

The build set is the standard one suggested by OpenOffice.org, I added
gdiplus.dll.

Last time I build OOo successfully on Windows XP with ooo-build was on
2.0.2.4 (2006-03-31 ChangeLog top).

The ooo-build/configure command line looks like:

./configure --with-lang='en-US it pt-BR de' --with-win32
--with-distro=&quot;FC-hs-Win32&quot;

I used the &quot;FC-hs-Win32&quot; distro because I added a few patches of my
own and the ooo-build/make stubbornly refused the Win32 node in
ooo-build/patches/src680/apply.
I didn't write down the ooo-build complain there though, and now I
don't remember now.

The ooo-build/distro-configs/FC-hs-Win32.conf I'm using is:

--with-intro-bitmaps=\&quot;$SRCDIR/ooointro_gc.bmp $SRCDIR/ooonologointro.bmp\&quot;
--with-about-bitmaps=\&quot;$SRCDIR/openabout_gc.bmp $SRCDIR/openabout.bmp\&quot;
--with-vendor=\&quot;Acca Esse, I-10067\&quot;

--with-use-shell=tcsh
--enable-build-mozilla
--with-ant-home=$BUILDDIR/apache-ant-1.6.5

While in ooo-build/patches/src680/apply:

FC-hs-Win32 : Win32Common, hsOnly

While applying the patches, I found that the patch intros-scp2.diff,
didn't apply, I rebuilt it and attached to this mail.

Then I end up with OOo main configure ending with:

.....
checking solver path... default
configure: creating ./config.status
config.status: creating set_soenv

Test Complete
No environment file will be generated

There were no warnings

A very clean straight-through build - deferring dep generation
Bootstrapping
./build-ooo: line 84: ./bootstrap: No such file or directory
./build-ooo: line 84: ./bootstrap: No such file or directory
./build-ooo: line 84: ./bootstrap: No such file or directory
make: *** [stamp/build] Error 1

So I hacked ooo-build/bin/build-ooo changing the line where
&quot;--enable-check-only&quot; is added to the configure flags, by simply
disabling the check-only feature; then restarted make.

After all this the main build commenced, by building dmake.

-- 
Kind regards,
Giuseppe Castagno
