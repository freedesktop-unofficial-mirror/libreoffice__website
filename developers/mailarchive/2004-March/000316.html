<PRE>Hi Sachin,

	Firstly, it's worth always CC'ing the mailing list - I've done so in
reply; I hope you don't mind - it saves us from answering the same
question multiple times.

	Right - don't worry about it not being in bugzilla :-) just go for it.
Ultimately, there is some old / vestigal code in OO.o that never got
finished in both these areas; and there is some stuff Caolan did with
the RSA encryption; the pointers I have are:

	+ encryption: sw/source/core/sw3io/sw3misc.cxx, line 689
	+ XL encryption: sc/source/filter/excel/impop.cxx 
	                 (SC_XCL_USEDECR)
	+ <A HREF="http://www.csn.ul.ie/~caolan/Packages/wvDecrypt.html">http://www.csn.ul.ie/~caolan/Packages/wvDecrypt.html</A>

&gt;<i> Also has anything specifc decided about overcoming the general slowness

</I>
	Mark ? there is a speedup in 1.1.51 that is quite significant for cold
starts; I also asked to have an Intern look at the session
management/lifecycle stuff so we can have it (sanely) running in the
background which would make a big difference.

	HTH,

		Michael.
