	Great; a few more comments on that - but you should commit this over
the top of the diff in openoffice CVS currently.

&gt;<i> Regarding the second part of the bug (interactive handling of new file

	Up-stream 680 is not using the recent-files code (at all) - this is
prolly why they don't have the problem; we have to fix it in our branch
and then submit it up-stream; it's almost certainly caused by our
changes.

&gt;<i> +class Item {
</I>&gt;<i> +public:
</I>&gt;<i>  	char *uri;
</I>&gt;<i>  	char *mimeType;
</I>
	We should use native OO.o strings for these: OUStrings for both should
be sufficient I think; makes allocation lots easier and should bin some
of the daft helpers we have there (?).

&gt;<i> --- svtools/source/config/makefile.mk
</I>&gt;<i> --- svtools/util/makefile.mk
</I>
	We should just bin the changes to these files in our patch I think; no
point in adding old/stale stuff commented out up-stream.

	Apart from that looks nice; when you've fixed that - can you commit to
'openoffice' and file an IZ bug up-stream for this; and CC'
<A HREF="mailto:mh@openoffice.org">mh@openoffice.org</A> on it; I should think he'll help to get it integrated
/ send you to the right person. [ Oh, and you should update
openoffice/TODO to reflect what you've done =]

	Good work,

		Michael.
