<PRE>Hi Keith,

	Ha; so - not as misinformed as mine.

	So - all this stuff about angular eye slicing, virtual inches,
foot-pounds etc. is well beyond me; however in OO.o there are some
people that think when you are at 100% zoom - in the ideal world you
should be able to hold your printout up to the (flat etc.) screen and
see the perfect parity between the printed and on-screen page [ if your
monitor isn't lying about it's DPI ].

	It seems to me with an angular perspective, that instead you have to
press the sheet of paper to some virtual plane between yourself and the
display (or beyond) - is that so ?

	And/or is it a reasonable thing to want this behavior ? and if so -
would it be sensible to have a &quot;believe the monitor really&quot; setting in
the Gnome font settings 'Font rendering details' dialog ?

	Either way - I'm well in favour of the status quo in our OO.o - just
using the XGetDefault and falling back to the DPI, but others are
thinking differently; insight appreciated.

	Thanks,

		Michael.

(rudely quoting lots of noise for Chris (and the OO.o list's sake)):
&gt;<i> There are two separate issues which this discussion has conflated.  The 
</I>&gt;<i> first is how wide to make various objects on the screen and the second is 
</I>&gt;<i> how big to make the text.  I argue that they should be treated 
</I>&gt;<i> as independent configuration options.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The perceived resolution of the screen (it's &quot;dpi&quot;) is a factor of the 
</I>&gt;<i> physical size of the pixels and the distance between the eye and the 
</I>&gt;<i> display surface.  In essence, &quot;inches&quot; on the screen aren't a linear 
</I>&gt;<i> measure, but rather an angular one, make an image 10 times bigger and move 
</I>&gt;<i> it 10 times further away and objects need to stay the same pixel size 
</I>&gt;<i> while getting 10 times larger to be perceived as the same size.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, distances along the screen should be measured by angle instead of by 
</I>&gt;<i> linear dimension.  This makes measurements on billboard displays make some 
</I>&gt;<i> sense in relation to how large to present various objects.  The obvious 
</I>&gt;<i> question now is what units do we use.  I suggest that we call them 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;inches&quot; and understand that we're talking about the length of an arc with 
</I>&gt;<i> radius of 18 inches or so -- the nominal distance from the eye to a 
</I>&gt;<i> typical PC screen.  This retains the &quot;dpi&quot; notion of resolution, but 
</I>&gt;<i> decouples that from the physical monitor resolution and lets us reason 
</I>&gt;<i> about how to compute better dpi values for different environments.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Linus argued persuasively that all PC screens are the &quot;same&quot; angular size;
</I>&gt;<i> the size which the user can comfortably fit in their field of view without
</I>&gt;<i> undo eye or head movement.  If this was indeed the case, we could actually 
</I>&gt;<i> compute dots-per-&quot;inch&quot; by dividing the pixel size of the monitor by a 
</I>&gt;<i> constant (&quot;inches&quot; per FOV).  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I argued that this computation would need to be adjusted based on the
</I>&gt;<i> context of the display -- a handheld device will occupy less of the
</I>&gt;<i> practical FOV than a desktop machine; the screen cannot be brought closer
</I>&gt;<i> than arms length because of the need to handle the device for input.
</I>&gt;<i> Similarly, projector environments have a wide range of FOV occupancy and
</I>&gt;<i> user interfaces for them will have to present information in a way that is
</I>&gt;<i> usable at a wide range of apparent sizes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In any case, I'm getting side tracked by related issues.  Back to the task 
</I>&gt;<i> at hand.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now that the DPI value is not fixed by the physical display device, I 
</I>&gt;<i> suggest that we can adjust the scale factor of the entire UI by changing 
</I>&gt;<i> this value.  Want to make the whole system twice as tall?  Double the DPI.
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think we would present DPI to the user, just a knob that adjusts 
</I>&gt;<i> the size of the presentation.  This knob is related to setting the current 
</I>&gt;<i> screen size and should probably be presented in that configuration UI.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The separate issue is how large to make text -- this is not connected with 
</I>&gt;<i> the above discussion as the desired size of text in dialogs depends on the 
</I>&gt;<i> font selected, the language in use and a bunch of other user preferences.  
</I>&gt;<i> One obvious example is when using Han characters -- you want a large font 
</I>&gt;<i> and yet you don't want the rest of the dialog spacing to increase.  So,
</I>&gt;<i> I think we should have a control which sets the base size of font elements 
</I>&gt;<i> in the UI and let the user frob the knob to suit as a part of selecting 
</I>&gt;<i> the UI fonts.  I suspect that most users would feel comfortable selecting 
</I>&gt;<i> font sizes in points.  The above setting gives us a conversion from points 
</I>&gt;<i> to pixels which will cause the selected point size to be additionally 
</I>&gt;<i> scaled by the preferred value for &quot;dpi&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;dpi&quot; should be configured to a default value automatically.  For PC 
</I>&gt;<i> displays, we can use Linus's rule above until we find something better.  
</I>&gt;<i> For handheld displays, I suspect we'll have to use a combination of the 
</I>&gt;<i> physical and pixel sizes along with a standard arm's length distance to 
</I>&gt;<i> compute logical DPI.  We can guess with projectors, but I suspect users 
</I>&gt;<i> will need to grab the knob to fix things.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Xinerama has an effect on all of this as well; as Xinerama is really just 
</I>&gt;<i> a kludge for &quot;real&quot; multi-screen setups, it's clear we should treat 
</I>&gt;<i> Xinerama as a collection of separate screens rather than one large screen. 
</I>&gt;<i> This means we should apply Linus's rule to a single physical screen rather 
</I>&gt;<i> than the union of them in logical form.
