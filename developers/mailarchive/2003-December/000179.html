<PRE>Hi there,

	Firstly - great work at the conference - it sounds wonderful, I'm
looking forward to seeing the photos etc. When it's all over and you've
slept - it'd be nice to do a short write-up from the OO.o angle, so we
can post it as a news item on ooo.ximian.com to get people excited; and
post it on the OO.o discuss list.

	What we need for OO.o source on a CD is:

	ooo-build-1.1.47.2.tar.bz2
	OOO_1_1_0.tar.bz2
	ooo-icons-OOO_1_1-6.tar.gz
	binutils-2.13.2.1.tar.bz2
	gcc-3.2.2.tar.bz2

	All of these can be found on <A HREF="http://ooo.ximian.com/packages/">http://ooo.ximian.com/packages/</A> it's well
worth checking the md5sums of them when you've got them though. [ It'd
be best perhaps to get the gcc,icons,binutils,OOO packages from a local
hacker like Anil since they are pretty huge ]. They're about ~200Mb or
so.

	We could put the HEAD OO.o stuff in, but it hasn't diverged _that_ much
from stable in a few months, and we want people to hack on stable with
us anyway I think for the next while. If we were to ship HEAD, we'd need
to take a snapshot tar.gz and setup ooo-build so it would patch / make
it nicely [ shouldn't be too hard a job though ].

	HTH,

		Michael.
