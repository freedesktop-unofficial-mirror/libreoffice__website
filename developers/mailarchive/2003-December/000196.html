I tried this with the latest i386 build and it works ok without
crashing.

Normally I could log into the powerpc machine where I built the packages
and get the symbols for you, but it has been unavailable since the
Debian compromise and I don't have access to any other powerpc machine
either.  There are a few powerpc-only illegal instruction problems
already reported in the Debian BTS; there is a small chance yours is
related.

It would be very helpful if you could test this using a vanilla 1.1.0
tar.gz install.  If it doesn't happen there, please file a bug report in
the debian BTS with severity important.

Thanks,
Chris
