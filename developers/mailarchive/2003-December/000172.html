<PRE>Hello,

I am the Tamil module coordinator for GTP.
[now subscribed to the CC'ed list as I am naturally interested in OOo
too]

Tamil is supported to satisfactory levels as of Pango 1.2.5 upwards.

So at a time when good Gnome l10n can be restarted I was annoyed to find
out that the little l10n community that has been amassed getting forked
with the dedicated OOo l10n started. Worryingly that it turn looked
threatening to fork in two but it might be able to be stopped.

Apart from stopping any such splits I want to work towrds a more
colloborative l10n effort if possible. More than anyone you will
appreciate the need for uniformity.
In fact it would be great if the whole Gnome Office suite could be
localised uniformly. 

Reusing strings without breaking the carefully constructed FSF
copyrights is the primary goal (for me).

Is there any one on the list who is already working with a GTP module
and OOo l10n?
If such a person exists I believe most of my questions could be answered
easily.

I now realise that OOo does not use PO files (instead a Glossary?). 

What is the 
1/ copyright and 
2/ licence 
terms on this?

Is the Sun licence also GPL compatible?

Finally does the XD2/OOo/Gnome integration bring in any more strings,
copyright issues.

There is more :-) but ona seperate mail to the list as I want to
understand Gnome integration.

All the best,

Ramanan
