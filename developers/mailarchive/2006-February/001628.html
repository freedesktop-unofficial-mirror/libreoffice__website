<PRE>Thanks Michael,
you for your reply it was very helpful.

Why!? Is there a technical reason?
Or 'political' Gnome-related? It would be sad.
In previous milestone it worked for me fine even under KDE, so why 'remove' working functionality.

&gt;<i> prolly we should improve the detection of
</I>&gt;<i> whether we should show that option or not.
</I>
Wold be better to enable it under KDE and other desktops too ;-)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I discovered in programs dir ooqstart executable and library
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; libqstart_gtk680li.so There is even  ooqstart desktop file!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But when I tried to launch  ooqstart manually: # ooqstart
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	Ah - so this is another 'quick-starter' ;-) the 1st works by sitting
</I>&gt;<i> around all the time; the 2nd is just a much more efficient factory
</I>&gt;<i> worker - that is faster in both KDE &amp; GNOME.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ** ERROR **: Missing default argument in OOO_EXTRA_ARG
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	Don't run it directly - run it via 'oowrapper' - which should call that
</I>&gt;<i> with the right environment,
</I>
I got it! I was already using it since oowriter executable is basically a simple two-line shell script calling ooqstarter with '-writer' attribute. That's all the magic :-)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I had some positive experience with quicksater in milestone
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 143 it speed up start significantly, but for m151 am currently
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; testing seems to be broken.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	Nah ;-) you're just running the wrong thing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; How this 'load during system startup' functionality is technically done?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Should I put 'ooqstart.desktop' to '~/.kde/Autostart'?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No - there is some pre-existing KDE quick-starter which you should
</I>&gt;<i> prolly use instead; I forget the details - we ship such a thing with
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSUSE I believe; best to use that I guess.
</I>
OK, I can check this. Is it in separate RPM or a part of OOo (Ooo-kde-integration)?
But I really don't mind to run GTK applet on my KDE desktop. I'm not KDE/Qt fanatic at any sence.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So there is the internal quickstarter (ooqstart) - GTK based -
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and the external quickstarter oooqs2 - KDE based. I suppose the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; internal one would be more efficient then the external one. Am
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I right?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sure - I guess so; by a bit. What is amazing to me though, is that it
</I>&gt;<i> *seems* [random user-feeling starts] that the quick-starter is slower to
</I>&gt;<i> start than the ooqstart launch loading a file on double-click: which is
</I>&gt;<i> odd [/end random user-feeling ;-]
</I>
Well, my experience was slightly different. There was a perceivable difference plus no splash, window quickly open in right size etc. Nothing like 200% boost, but every percent counts :)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The runtime option -quickstart is said to be unsupported for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; OOo2. Is that true for ooo-build patched releases too?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes I believe so; the whole session/lifecycle stuff wrt. the
</I>&gt;<i> -quickstart stuff is really broken for OO.o itself.
</I>
What about the Windows quickstarter?  It works for m fine too?
Why this feature is possible on Windows for a long time and so problematic in Linux?

Looking forward to the reply
Jan
