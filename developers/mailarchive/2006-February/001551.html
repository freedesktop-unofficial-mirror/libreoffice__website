<PRE>Hi all!
I reworked some system java patches and am going to include them
in new SystemJavaBits section.

I worked on these patches:
workspace.systemjava.patch from iz#52974
system-xt.diff,
xmlsearch-plain-xt.diff,
xt-precompile.diff from ooo-build

My aim is to obsolete these distro specific patches which are in
ooo-build right now. So that all can use the SystemJavaBits section
to get use of their system java resources.

You can build with:
system beanshell (tested)
system hsqldb (untested)
system xalan (tested)
system xerces (tested)
system xml-apis (tested)
system xt (tested)

One question is left:
1. Is it ok to build xt-xmlsearch.jar in XmlSearch module?

I leave it there for now because I do not want to create a new xt
module like it is done in system-xt.diff.


You may have a look at my patches which are attached.
If anyone tests and reports back with results I am glad.

I may also mention that I added or changes some parts
after test-build started. They should not be problematic, though.
And this is only for review. I will rebuilt OOo with my patches
this weekend. If I get a successful build I add the
SystemJavaBits section.


Regards,
Hanno
