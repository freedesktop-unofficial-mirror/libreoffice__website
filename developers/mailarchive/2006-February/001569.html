Of course Caolan is correct :-) and there is indeed a missing 
dependency. Since m154 qpro is disabled ( there was a dependency line 
for vba in sc/prj/build.lst ) in that patch set ( they were in the same 
patch because qpro &amp; vba were patching the same line ) Anyway it appears 
that when the conditional patches for &gt;= m154 were generated this line 
was missed.

I didn't realise you were talking about multiproc builds ( somehow my 
mind just assumed icecream ) so in fact I was able to reproduce this 
here and play with it. I was able to make it fail consistently quite 
easily in the end

cd sc/unxlngi6.pro/slb/vbaobj.lib
rm unoobj.lib  vbaobj.lib  lotus.lib
build -P 6 ( or higher, 6 fails every time for me )

so update from head should fix the problem now. Sorry 'bout all the 
trouble :-(

Noel
