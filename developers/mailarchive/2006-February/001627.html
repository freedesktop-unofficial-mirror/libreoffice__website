	Ok - that is GNOME only; prolly we should improve the detection of
whether we should show that option or not.

	Ah - so this is another 'quick-starter' ;-) the 1st works by sitting
around all the time; the 2nd is just a much more efficient factory
worker - that is faster in both KDE &amp; GNOME.

&gt;<i> ** ERROR **: Missing default argument in OOO_EXTRA_ARG

	Don't run it directly - run it via 'oowrapper' - which should call that
with the right environment,

	Nah ;-) you're just running the wrong thing.

&gt;<i> How this 'load during system startup' functionality is technically done?
</I>&gt;<i> Should I put 'ooqstart.desktop' to '~/.kde/Autostart'?
</I>
	No - there is some pre-existing KDE quick-starter which you should
prolly use instead; I forget the details - we ship such a thing with
OpenSUSE I believe; best to use that I guess.

&gt;<i> So there is the internal quickstarter (ooqstart) - GTK based -
</I>&gt;<i> and the external quickstarter oooqs2 - KDE based. I suppose the
</I>&gt;<i> internal one would be more efficient then the external one. Am
</I>&gt;<i> I right?
</I>
	Sure - I guess so; by a bit. What is amazing to me though, is that it
*seems* [random user-feeling starts] that the quick-starter is slower to
start than the ooqstart launch loading a file on double-click: which is
odd [/end random user-feeling ;-]

&gt;<i> The runtime option -quickstart is said to be unsupported for
</I>&gt;<i> OOo2. Is that true for ooo-build patched releases too?
</I>
	Yes I believe so; the whole session/lifecycle stuff wrt. the
-quickstart stuff is really broken for OO.o itself.

	HTH,

		Michael.
