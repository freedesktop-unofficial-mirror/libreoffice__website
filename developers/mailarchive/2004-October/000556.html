<PRE>So, I was working on &quot;WriterPerfect&quot; (the OOo WordPerfect filter
component) around two weeks ago, and found it to be a total pain: the
filter wasn't installing, and I didn't know why, because OpenOffice.org
is a big pain the rear (it turned out the UNO registration stuff
couldn't find a symbol). This motivated me to do something I've been
thinking about for a long time: merge WriterPerfect and wpd2sxw (the
standalone application for converting wpd -&gt; OOo).

The new architecture goes something like this:
- A shared &quot;libwriterperfect&quot; that outputs SAX messages to an abstract
object called &quot;DocumentHandler&quot;.
- wpd2sxw creates something called a DiskDocumentHandler, which flushes
all the SAX messages to an OOo-loadable .zip file. Alternately, it can
flush to standard output, flat-xml style (I plan on using that
capability to add automated regression testing for WriterPerfect).
- The (forthcoming) &quot;new&quot; WriterPerfect plugin will create an
OODocumentHandler which will send all the SAX messages to the
OpenOffice.org framework. With luck, this will someday find its way into
OpenOffice.org CVS proper.

What this brings us:
1. Easier regression testing of WriterPerfect. Now we can use a sane
command-line utility to see what's gone wrong with a minor change! This
will also make it _much_ easier to refactor WriterPerfect in the future.
2. We can debug build/linker problems with a tiny, sane, stand-alone
application.
3. Our users get a funky way of mass-converting their old WordPerfect
documents without the overhead of using OOo.

Now, you could possibly argue that I could do most/all of this using the
OOo framework, and you would be correct-- my reason for taking this
approach is that it's _much_ easier to work with a loosely coupled
framework like this one.

What needs immediate work:
- The win32 build stuff needs to be updated.
- There's A LOT of string allocation/conversion going on right now: this
needs to be reduced (even so, wpd2sxw is quite fast on my P4-2ghz). :-)
- We need to update all the packaging.
- We need to write an integrated filter using this new framework (all
the pieces are already there: they just need to be moved around)

Open questions:
1. Should WriterPerfect be a stand-alone library, or should we just link
it statically? (I guess in Debian/RedHat you'd just have a
libwriterperfect-devel package)
2. Might there be some advantage to making the upcoming Lotus Word Pro
filter to export a libwpd interface (see: <A HREF="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/">http://cvs.sourceforge.net/</A>
viewcvs.py/libwpd/libwpd2/src/lib/WPXHLListenerImpl.h?
rev=1.56&amp;view=auto) and use this framework? It would relieve it of the
burden of manually constructing most of the OpenOffice.org document
(styles are a particular pain here), and you would get the above
features for free (PLUS AbiWord would get a LWP filter!). Obviously some
effort would be required to remove some of the libwpd-isms from our
interfaces (in fact I would suggest starting a new project to encompass
&quot;generic text filter&quot; functionality), but I think the overall benefits
would make this worthwhile.

Looking forward to everyone's thoughts,
