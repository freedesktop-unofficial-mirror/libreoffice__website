René - Thanks. I was unaware of NLD, etc. until Michael mentioned it. I
guess what I'm looking for - in the context of Novell's integration (or
assimilation or whatever) of SuSE and Ximian - is a clear upgrade path.
I run SuSE Pro 9.0 with XD2, including Evolution 1.4.6, Red Carpet
2.2.3, and Ximian's version of oOo 1.1.1. I counted on RC for doing
updates, including updates to SuSE, and have not used YaST for updates
because I encountered conflicts between SuSE and Ximian versions of
Gnome (gdm2) early on. This is broader than the purpose of this
particular list, I know, so I won't press on. I guess I'll just sit
tight for a while. Thanks.  Kelly
