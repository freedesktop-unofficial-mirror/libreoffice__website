A few notes while my system seems to be building happily...

Looks like bin.setup looks for bin/setup.configure to pick up the config 
switches unless they are set in an environment variable.
If setup.configure is there, it reads them from it, if it is not, but 
CONFIGURE_OPTIONS is set, it gets them from there, and then saves them 
to setup.configure, otherwise it uses a default set of options
This doesn't work the first time round because the main ./configure 
doesn't set CONFIGURE_OPTIONS, so it uses the default set of options. 
Once its set up properly it looks like it'll work though...

For Fedora Core 3 test builds, I needed to add a patch from 
<A HREF="http://www.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=34676">http://www.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=34676</A> (thanks 
Caolan)because of the relatively recent gcc version.

It would be great if there were a list of distros valid for 
--with-distro= somewhere. It seems to require --with-distro=NLD on my 
Fedora system which is amusing
