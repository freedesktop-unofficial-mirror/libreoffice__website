<PRE>Hi guys,

	So - I've just branched ooo-build, HEAD will now be targetting
snapshots of the up-stream 2.0 version, aiming to stabilise them &amp;
produce a version that can be built / released / worked with quickly.
This is really in response to the treacle-like integration of CWS'
making it extremely difficult to get many interlocking changes into
HEAD.

	Hopefully, we'll be able to whittle down our patch set quickly, and
pull in new snapshots since we'll be working with a development branch.
Also, hopefully the CWS merge process will be accelerated in due course
&amp; we'll be able to move to work with that fully at some stage.

	The 'stable' code now lurks on the 'ooo-build-1-3' branch; and various
sub-branches of it 'ooo-build-1-3-5', 'ooo-build-1-3-5-3' and so on :-)

	Oh, and of course, HEAD will not be buildable for some days yet.

	HTH,

		Michael.
