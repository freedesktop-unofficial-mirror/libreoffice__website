<PRE>Hi

I'm trying to find out what's involved in certain CWSs. Using EIS I can 
see the issues attached to a CWS but not what actual files have been 
changed and the changes made.
So what I'd really like to do is get a patch that corresponds to all the 
changes made in that CWS.
The cws tools (and the ooo-build enhancement cws-extract) should be able 
to do that.
However, because I'm not a Domain Developer and don't have a OOo CVS 
account, I can't access the EIS SOAP service that lets you do that.
So two proposals:
1) It would be nice to access the EIS SOAP service without a CVS write 
account
2) In the mean time, it would be nice if either EIS or some other web 
site provided such patches. They need not be generated dynamically, a 
nightly run of cws-extract would be great and they could offer static 
links to the patches.

What do people think?
David
