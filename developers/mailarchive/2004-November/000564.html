<PRE>Hi,

This is for those who are interested in building HEAD, the development branch. 
(Not recommended ;) )

I updated patches/src680 to be against src680-m60 now. The patches that were 
problematic with m60 are moved to patches/src680-m57, as well as the patches 
that are obsolete.

Please note that the default tag is still src680-m57, because m60 does not 
contain 'instsetoo', just 'instsetoo_native', and I did not adapt the 
'install' makefile rule yet. I'll announce when finished.

Should you do any changes to 'apply', please do it in patches/src680-m57 as 
well as in patches/src680-m60 so that the switch to m60 will be easier.

Thank you,
Jan
