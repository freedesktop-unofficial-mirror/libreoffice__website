<PRE>Hi Hanno,

	Ah ! - ok, I downloaded it and started to have a poke:

	* Why are you not pushing this back to us as patches ? *
		+ there seems to be some good stuff in there

	eg. I just added the Gentoo targets to patches/OOO_1_1_3/apply, you
should be able to configure with --distro=Gentoo to make it work nicely
there.

&gt;<i> No, the Mandrake OOo maintainer missed the cpputype.cxx diff to inject.

</I>&gt;<i> installation issues because of connectivity problem ( missing mozilla
</I>&gt;<i> libraries ). He is working on it or whatever. No contact anymore
</I>&gt;<i> because my work is done.
</I>
	So - some other questions;

	* Why do you need so much code in penoffice-ximian-1.4.ebuild ?
		+ the package is setup for 'make' 'make install', 
		  package
		+ can you not re-use eg. bin/unpack, or some of the 
		  Makefile.shared rules; eg. 'make patch.apply' ?
	
	* Why add patches to the gentoo package but not ooo-build ?

	I've added your gcc34 patches; and created a GentooOnly section that
includes those patches. It'd be great to get your work in there, so
other distros can re-use / test / bug-fix &amp; we share the packaging
burden - that's the philosophy behind it at least. How can we help you
do that ?

	HTH,

		Michael.
