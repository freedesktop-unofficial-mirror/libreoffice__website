<PRE>In a 60-page document, I inserted a couple of spreadsheets that each
took up one page. I now need to delete them and replace them with 
different spreadsheets. I successfully deleted the first, but I am
unable to delete the second one. It seems to be &quot;anchored&quot; to its
position. When I try to delete it, it &quot;skips&quot; to the page following the
spreadsheet and begins deleting text there. I would appreciate any
guidance.

TIA  Kelly Morris
