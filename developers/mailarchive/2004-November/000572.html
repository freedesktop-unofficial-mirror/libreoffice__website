<PRE>&gt;<i> Why so long there are not such beatiful and interesting mails with
</I>&gt;<i> subject 'Status day_of_the_week'?
</I>&quot;Your wish is my command&quot;. Well this one time at least!! ;)

Status Last Week:

1) Got this weird configure problem with m57
/configure
mozilla - external
mozilla-xpcom regisrty not found 

The last build of m57 that i had identified mozilla as internal. Fiddled
around this for a day with no result.

2) Made a huge list of patches which are still to be checked in and
categorized them based on
understanding/relevancy/amount-of-tinkering-needed/what-needs-to-be-done.

This was done as i kept stumbling on patches i had seen before and not
remembering them in great detail. 

3) Started fixing a couple of broken patches. Should get them committed
on monday.

4) Was down with fever, cold, throat pain for about 2 days :( 

Cheers,
Shreyas
