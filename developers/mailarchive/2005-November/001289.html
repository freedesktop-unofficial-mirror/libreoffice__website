<PRE>Hi Tor,

	Volker - Tor (tml on IRC) is working on the OO.o team now - and will be
doing some Win32 work; and he's also going to take care of the tinderbox
infrastructure from our side, he's an extremely sharp guy.

	Tor - Volker is an old-hand Win32 OO.o hacker / builder etc. - who
wrote most of the accurate bits in the Win32 build guide, and has all
manner of great schemes on the boil - building with free compilers etc.
etc. (is also a post-doc laser / gravity-wave expert :-) 'vq' on IRC,
he's in east-coast time, IIWY I'd grab him on IRC &amp; have a chat / see
how we can get involved helping make OO.o easier to build on Win32 -
particularly with cheap tooling etc.

	Anyhow - this is about the tinderbox bits ...

	Great :-) You should be able to do:

	ssh <A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/openoffice">ooo at go-oo.org</A>

	now. Here is the deal with the tinderbox:

	check ooo-build/www/tinder-scripts/tinder-build - this is a prototype
build script that we want to encourage people to setup.

	Here is the big-plan for how this (should) work:

	* There is a script running as 'michael' on go-oo.org [ since
	  it needs an EIS password - possibly we should work on
	  using the 'guest' account for that instead ].
		* Checkout the 'EIS' link from go-oo.org &amp; have a browse

	* We then generate a list of cvs branches in the 'ready for QA'
	  state; ( and also a list of master workspaces) from that 
	  script - these get dumped &amp; updated regularly at:
	  <A HREF="http://go-oo.org/tinderbox/tags/">http://go-oo.org/tinderbox/tags/</A> in a suitably easy-to-parse 
	  format that requires only a simple 'wget'.

	* The idea then is that we grab one of these at random check it
	  out &amp; build it - then E-mail the log to <A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/openoffice">ooo at go-oo.org.</A>

	* <A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/openoffice">ooo at ooo.ximian.com</A> [ has to be used for some odd MX record 
	  reason isntead of go-oo.org ] has a .procmail script that
	  uncompresses &amp; processes those logs &amp; builds the tinderbox
	  pages.

	* <A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/openoffice">ooo at go-oo.org</A> has a crontab that runs every 5 minutes or so
	  (crontab -e) to re-generate the tinderbox pages at:
	  <A HREF="http://go-oo.org/tinderbox/">http://go-oo.org/tinderbox/</A> This also uses the data in 
	  tag-list etc. to ensure that the 'live' branches are
	  presented dynamically

	So far, so good :-)

	What are we missing ?

	a) it's not clear to me that tinder-build works very well
		+ it needs verifying on Linux &amp; Win32 &amp; improving
		  to work out-of-the-box as much as possible

	b) it's certain that it doesn't work very performantly, we
	   should be downloading (&amp; caching) source archives from the
	   milestones I think to accelerate that - and then just 
	   updating the few modules in each cws - for better speed
	   [ my current runs just spend all their time cvs
	     checkouting ]

	c) We need more active build slaves - when we've improved
	   the performance with b) I have an idling dual-processor
	   (64bit sadly =&gt; no java) Linux box here waiting to chew
	   some bits for this; when we're confident we need to
	   evangelize this to all &amp; sundry to get tinderbox slaves
	   setup.

	The overall reason for wanting to do this (of course) is that we can
catch all the compiler bugs / bloopers that make the milestones not
build on common distros / compilers way before they ever get integrated
into the main-line &amp; thus improve the quality of builds from the stock
milestones.

	So - clearly improving &amp; maintaining this is one of these long-term
background tasks, Volker has prolly a better idea of what works
currently - do get in touch with him.

	Thanks,

		Michael.
