</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>	Sure - that's easy enough to sort out; eg. the Gnome VFS is not only

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>	I guess; I imagine even if the result was something that looked like

</I>&gt;<i>tends to lead to the very bloat &amp; madness people want to avoid but ...
</I>&gt;<i>c'est la vie ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>	Either way the more interesting problems a shared vfs solves are
</I>&gt;<i>standardisation, consistent URI parsing/mangling across the system, more
</I>&gt;<i>re-use in other projects (eg. OO.o), shared maintainership etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>	IMHO it's an excellent idea to create a new shared VFS - with a feature
</I>&gt;<i>super-set of what exists but - generating rational compromise in Free
</I>&gt;<i>software communities is excessively difficult often :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>	My 2 cents,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>		Michael.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Yes. I also agree that a shared-VFS would be the best solution. The 
generic desktop adapter is thought to be a more realistic short term 
solution (for the next years) - and perhaps as an interface for other 
desktop features which can't or shouldn't be moved to common infrastructure.

There has been lots of discussion about D-VFS on the xdg list, but the 
spec on fd.org is too superficial, also because neither the Gnome nor 
the KDE developers want to dive into the details of the opposite sides 
VFS implementation. Just discussing and specifying doesn't seem to work 
for this particular problem. I got the impression that D-VFS is dead.

The problem with D-VFS is who's gonna start coding it (I could try, but 
i can't afford doing such a huge thing as a hobby project ;-)).

I have played with that VFS stuff a bit (i tried to write a KIO-&gt;Gnome 
VFS bridge once - called gvfs-kio), coded a very lightweight IPC library 
called TVariant and wrote down my thoughts on that topic...
