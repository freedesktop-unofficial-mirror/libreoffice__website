	Nah - that's a non-issue, we don't want to produce 10's of
high-contrast themes, we need only one.

&gt;<i> OOo in KDE doesn't like to change the theme without restarting (an 
</I>&gt;<i> official OOo issue I've just noticed).
</I>
	That's just an artefact of a missing link somewhere wrt. theme change
propagation; Kendy is on holiday, I'm sure he'll fix when he gets back.

&gt;<i> Steps to reproduce:
</I>&gt;<i> 1 - Open OOo Ximian in GNOME or Windows
</I>&gt;<i> 2 - Change the theme to black high contrast
</I>&gt;<i> 3 - Change the theme to another one (e.g., white high contrast)
</I>
	Ok - so; yes - it seems some 'accessible' tag is getting 'stuck' here -
and we're getting confused.

	Jan - if you switch to a high-contrast theme in GNOME, then back to
industrial - we get stuck on the a11y icons for some reason.

	Thanks Caio for the report :-) Jan's on holiday for another week or so.
Of course - if you want to have a tinker yourself, the patch is:

	ooo-build/patches/src680/icons-switching*

	Regards,

		Michael.
