</I>
	Both really :-) not needed &amp; personally I don't want to invest the
hundreds of thousands of dollars to produce a new high-contrast theme
from Novell. Of course - it turns out that people like doing this for
free - there is a nice new, clean high-contrast SVG icon set that some
of Kendy's artist friends have been working on that may make it to
completion some day.

&gt;<i> Can someone call the new icons a feature and integrate it?
</I>
	If you have artwork you want integrated - the best thing to do is to
talk to Jan (back Monday). Wrt. up-stream integration, the CWS is going
through QA - for integration into 2.0.2, so it should be more widely
available hopefully.

	Thanks,

		Michael.
