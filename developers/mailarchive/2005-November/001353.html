</I>&gt;<i> Hi Petr,

</I>&gt;<i> Is there any way I can get those patches?

Yes, I'm also very interested in this. Since we FreeBSD people doesn't
have a released Java; so we must use GNU/Linux version for bootstrapping.
of course we need sources as well. To download the source we must accept
SCSL which many people don't want to accept. I know gcc-4.0.2 compiles
OOo for GNU/Linux but it doesn't for FBSD; AWT somehow doesn't work just
dumped cores. I tried many snapshots, and recently AWT peer via GTK
works for me. (afaik after September or something; but builds were broken due
to regressions or changes in gcc).
Currently gcc41 becomes solid but failed where you pointed out at
<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/openoffice">dev at porting.</A> Well we can use ooo-build, but for FreeBSD, it requires porting.
I alywas commit to FBSD specific patches to ports cvs repo, but not
for ooo-build. maintaining both are very hard.

This is the reason why I'm very very interested in your patch, so
could you please send me as well?

Many thanks for your hard work!
