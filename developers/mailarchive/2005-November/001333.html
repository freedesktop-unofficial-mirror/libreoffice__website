&gt;<i> I guess 95% of desktop users don't care about theming. They just want to
</I>&gt;<i> get their work done and don't even realize such differences. Regarding
</I>&gt;<i> addressbooks and drag and drop i just don't know if the desktop adapter
</I>&gt;<i> can help here. I have no experience with those issues, but maybe you can
</I>&gt;<i> give me some hints.
</I>
For the address book, yes, since I am writing the KDE address book driver for 
OpenOffice.org.

Contemporary desktop environments like GNOME or KDE are much more than a 
window manager :
- they provide transparent, network-aware file access
- they have a consistent look and feel. I don't think myself this is a minor 
issue. Multiplication of look and feel and libraries under Linux means 
freedom of choice, but also a huge mess for the end user, and a waste of 
system ressources.
- they enable dragging and dropping of files between applications : think 
about dragging a picture from your desktop onto your OpenOffice.org letter, 
or a file from Firefox onto your desktop
- they make application share common ressources, like the address book 
addresses, but also many user settings like your name, your network provider, 
and so on
- they provide a centralized configuration mechanism, eventually a 
configuration cache
- they provide an integrated help system
- they maintain a list of mimetypes and/or file extensions
- they provide icons and localization of the desktop items
- they have a sound layer
- they support scripting protocols
- they offer inter application communication
- they permit to embed graphical components between applications
- etc

In short, they _share_ many, many resources between their own applications. 
What they do not do is sharing them with third party applications.

&gt;<i> The desktop adapter is designed to be modular, 
</I>&gt;<i> therefore providing addressbook interfaces should be possible...
</I>
I think it should be part of the picture, yes.

&gt;<i> &gt;I suppose that kendy will be able to describe the topic better than I can.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is he on this list?
</I>
He is the one who coordinates the KDE / OpenOffice.org integration efforts. 
There's a good overview of this project at

	<A HREF="http://kde.openoffice.org">http://kde.openoffice.org</A>

I think your idea is basically good. I just regret it did not come much 
before... :-/ A lot of work has already be done in the integration area, but 
project by project...

From a practical point of view, projects like openoffice have already their 
own environment abstraction layers, which permit them to run for example 
under Windows. If a desktop adapter library arises, it will add yet another 
software layer.

Another solution would be to tackle the problems one by one. One library for 
the transparent network file I/O for example, another library for the access 
to the user settings, etc.

Just thinking aloud...
