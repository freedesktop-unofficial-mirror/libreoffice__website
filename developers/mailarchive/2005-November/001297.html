OK, let's go:
in the official OOo there is an &quot;accessibility version&quot; of the GUI 
icons. They have inverse colors. This version is intended to use with 
black high contrast themes, because black lines in a black background 
are invisible :D.
When you're using OOo and switch the desktop environment (windows or 
gnome) theme to black high contrast the icons change to the 
&quot;accessibility version&quot; and they switch back to the default if you 
change the theme without having to close OOo.

Ximian OOo has different icons, but they doesn't have an accessibility 
version (it, by itself, is an issue). If you switch to a black high 
contrast theme the icons change to the &quot;default OOo accessibility 
version&quot;, but it still in the &quot;default OOo accessibility version&quot; even 
if you change the theme to a non black high contrast one. So, the user 
see icons with blank lines in a blank background until restart OOo.

OOo in KDE doesn't like to change the theme without restarting (an 
official OOo issue I've just noticed).

Steps to reproduce:
1 - Open OOo Ximian in GNOME or Windows
2 - Change the theme to black high contrast
3 - Change the theme to another one (e.g., white high contrast)

Result:
The icons still with white lines

Expected results:
Icons with black lines

Tip:
Open a text document and see the lot of invisible icons (a lot of them 
still invisible when passing mouse over)
;)

Possible workaround:
forcing people to restart OOo

Consequences:
making it harder to work with OOo in an environment with people with 
visual disparities.
