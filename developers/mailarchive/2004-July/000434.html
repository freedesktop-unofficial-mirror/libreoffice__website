<PRE>Hi Martin,

	In the abstract - certainly yes.

&gt;<i> * have all authors signed JCA ? (I cannot  find one for  Frederico)
</I>
	Yes; this is our policy and practice; I'll refer to the web mirror of
our code, it's just what is in CVS, cf:
	<A HREF="http://ooo.ximian.com/ooo-build/HACKING">http://ooo.ximian.com/ooo-build/HACKING</A>

	Federico works for me, for Ximian, now Novell - so all his
contributions are covered under the Ximian/Novell blanket-assignment.

&gt;<i> * Do we have OOo issues for the patches ? Michael, I know you find it 
</I>&gt;<i> someway bureaucratic, but it makes my life of writing release notes more 
</I>&gt;<i> easy and exact (also QA will be happy if they are able to track the 
</I>&gt;<i> milestones).
</I>
	I try to file issues per patch; especially for the ones that can
usefully go up-stream easily. However, the practice varies amongst
people working on ooo-build, and we're not too anal ;-) best practice as
codified here: <A HREF="http://ooo.ximian.com/ooo-build.html#section-2.4">http://ooo.ximian.com/ooo-build.html#section-2.4</A> is to
commit to IZ before CVS.

&gt;<i> If the answer is no, how can we set up a plan, what needs to get in OOo 
</I>&gt;<i> and what not. Is everybody aware of the current plan for 2.0 (UI freeze 
</I>&gt;<i> end of July, Beta in October) or does anybody need a change of the plan ?
</I>
	Well - we hope to be working on the 2.0 branch more actively in a few
weeks/months. Whether the bugs get up-stream or not is _really_ more a
function of whether the Sun / IZ process is at all workable - so far,
without periodic kickings of backsides by interested parties [ Stefan /
you ] almost nothing would be merged up.

	OTOH, some of the bug numbers in the patches list, are things that have
been applied to HEAD, and will not be applied to stable; others are
plain back-ports of HEAD features; others have been (already)
gratuitously re-written up-stream, and we're waiting for someone to do
the work comparing / selecting / re-back-porting the new work. Some
other patches belong to essentially vendor-specific stuff, eg. strike-
versioning, branding patches etc. and yet others belong to in-progress
feature development.

	Anyhow - in total, it's great to have your interest / attention. The
best place for the latest patch / issues list is:
	<A HREF="http://ooo.ximian.com/ooo-build/patches/OOO_1_1_2/apply">http://ooo.ximian.com/ooo-build/patches/OOO_1_1_2/apply</A>

	Hope that helps,

		Michael.
