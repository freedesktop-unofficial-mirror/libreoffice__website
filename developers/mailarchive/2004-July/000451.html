	So I branched; and did some radical surgery, simplified a load of nasty
build conditionals, lots fell out of apply, removed a load of patches,
shrunk a chunk of others - and a few more remain to be looked at.

	So far very pleased with the results; the 'NLD' patch set (as it's now
known) seems to apply, and doing some build testing.

	One of the hardest bits was hoisting the VCL plug stuff to the top of
the patch list, and making other patches apply against it - this will
hopefully help with up-streaming in future.

	I feel more optimistic about the longer term maintenance prospects &amp;
general cleanliness of ooo-build now than I have for a while - which is
nice :-)

	Help getting the kinks ironed out much appreciated; I'm on the road
until Monday.

	Regards,

		Michael.
