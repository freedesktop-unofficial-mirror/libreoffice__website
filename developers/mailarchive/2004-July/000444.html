</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>before we can get to a compromise, we should know about each sides 
requirements, I can't imagine that they are that contrary now as they 
were in the past.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>BTW, I assume all of the mentioned authors already do have commit access ?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>To upstream OOo?  I'm not sure.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>	Um; it just turns out that we do have some sort of access - at least a
</I>&gt;<i>ssh tunnel to use; but whether we have the correct roles to check
</I>&gt;<i>anything in, I have no idea.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>we already talked about to establish ssh tunnel, I'm not aware of 
unclarities. All developers getting commit access are get access to all 
modules (on child workspaces) so I do not see any technical hurdles 
(only the usual political ones (JCA)) and that it might last 2-3 days to 
establish a new tunnel.

&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>wrt to 5.4 of the above document, I just can offer again something like 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>a tools/contrib/ooo-build or whatever similar is needed.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>	That sounds interesting. I think, ultimately we'll need to re-work a
</I>&gt;<i>lot of ooo-build for 2.0 - and hopefully we'll shrink it a lot at that
</I>&gt;<i>stage; I guess then we need to choose whether in fact it will be
</I>&gt;<i>possible to work with Sun - on a whole host of issues - _particularly_
</I>&gt;<i>release engineering related, or not - which will of course seriously
</I>&gt;<i>affect what happens.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>sounds like something we don't need to discuss, just need the work done ;).

&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I think Michael's reluctance was due to the very long time  needed to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>get everything set up for a new user, i.e. send JCA, wait a long time
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>for JCA to be processed, create issue with ssh key, wait a long time for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>ssh tunnel key to be added.  Do you see any way that the delays could be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>reduced in the future?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>	Yes - this is a pain; we're willing to accept someone's word in ooo-
</I>&gt;<i>build that someone has faxed / posted a JCA - and use cvs history to rip
</I>&gt;<i>their stuff out later in the (highly unlikely) event they are lying
</I>&gt;<i>through their teeth ;-&gt; [ never happened ].
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I do not expect that we can speed this up in the short term, but as an 
one time doing at the very beginning this is not that problem regarding 
ooo-build, I guess.

&gt;<i>	Unfortunately, our cvs account creation time is pretty bad now, since
</I>&gt;<i>the cvs.gnome.org attack binned the pretty web account creation
</I>&gt;<i>interface - a shame.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
&gt;<i>	Anyhow - enough waffle ;-) I've got patch back-porting to do.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>	Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>		Michael.
