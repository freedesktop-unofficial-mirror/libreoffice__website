<PRE>Hi Martin, thanks for taking the initiative on this :)

I think the list of issues in the apply file is a very good starting
point to go from as the list of outstanding patches.  The non-numbered
patches fall into a few groups:

 - Not suitable for all arches / OSes

 - Only make sense on a particular distro/subset of distros 
   (Those in XXXXOnly sections)

 - Experimental in nature, with known bugs or not fully tested.  It
   might help to mark them as such, or create an issue anyway.

 - Highly experimental patches :) Generally, those in unused sections
   towards the bottom of the apply file.

 - Patches which haven't had issues filed for them yet, but could be
   included upstream.   Actually, although Michael doesn't like the
   issue filing process, he's probably created issues for more of his
   patches than I have *blush*.  I still have to create issues for
   several of my patches.

&gt;<i> I really would like to fight 1.5 in 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://ooo.ximian.com/ooo-build.html,">http://ooo.ximian.com/ooo-build.html,</A> but it is difficult to track them all.
</I>
Is there some way we can mark issues to help track them?  Maybe
something as simple as adding

  ooo-build patch: [location of patch in ooo-build]

To the issue description text, so we can search for 'ooo-build' in the
issue query?

&gt;<i> BTW, I assume all of the mentioned authors already do have commit access ?
</I>
To upstream OOo?  I'm not sure.

&gt;<i> wrt to 5.4 of the above document, I just can offer again something like 
</I>&gt;<i> a tools/contrib/ooo-build or whatever similar is needed.
</I>
I think Michael's reluctance was due to the very long time  needed to
get everything set up for a new user, i.e. send JCA, wait a long time
for JCA to be processed, create issue with ssh key, wait a long time for
ssh tunnel key to be added.  Do you see any way that the delays could be
reduced in the future?

Chris
