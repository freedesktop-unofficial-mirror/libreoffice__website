<PRE>Hi guys,

	In light of the VCL plug stuff landing; I'd very much like to propose
branching ooo-build, leaving the HEAD stuff to use VCL Plug, and letting
anyone who is interested continue working on / releasing the non-VCL-
Plug stuff.

	I'm planning on doing this on a 'scream now or it gets done' type basis
- so; please do ;-)

	I propose a branch name of: ooo-build-1-1, and a switch to 1.1.3
versions on HEAD or somesuch.

	Here's why VCL plug is a good thing:

		+ includes m45 psprint (CUPS integration etc.)
		+ includes pugabble, dlopened NWF backends instead
		  of evil hard-linkage of KDE / gtk+ to the core
		  toolkit.
		+ includes gtk+ file selector integration
		+ includes gtk+ top-level window integration
		+ [ easy to back-port Win32 NWF stuff ;-]

	Here's why VCL plug is a bad thing:
		+ 80,000 lines of patch, vs 10,000 nativewidget-*
		+ much of the patch irrelevant 'REMOTE_APPSERVER'
		  type removal / cleanup
		+ patch overlaps with some system-*, fontconfig* bits
		+ not completely finished

	So - I clearly want to fix the patch overlap issues pleasantly, and
finish this all up; preferably without having to maintain parallel
patches; 'NotVCLPLug' sections in apply etc. I think with a much more
integrated, and sane code-base we can pull out some of the more whacky /
duff patches that have built up and make ooo-build more comprehensible /
cool.

	Thoughts ? throttling ? :-)

	Thanks,

		Michael.
