	I believe some 'patch' keyword was added to some of the bugs with
patches; to make them easier to track - but - yes. Ultimately - I would
like us to be able to work with up-stream, in CVS, rather than having
some special mechanism / process for patch tagging in CVS though.
Unfortunately - this is going to require some hard-core compromise on
Sun's side [ I'm writing this up for a talk at OOoCon ].

</I>
	Um; it just turns out that we do have some sort of access - at least a
ssh tunnel to use; but whether we have the correct roles to check
anything in, I have no idea.

&gt;<i> &gt; wrt to 5.4 of the above document, I just can offer again something like 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a tools/contrib/ooo-build or whatever similar is needed.
</I>
	That sounds interesting. I think, ultimately we'll need to re-work a
lot of ooo-build for 2.0 - and hopefully we'll shrink it a lot at that
stage; I guess then we need to choose whether in fact it will be
possible to work with Sun - on a whole host of issues - _particularly_
release engineering related, or not - which will of course seriously
affect what happens.

&gt;<i> I think Michael's reluctance was due to the very long time  needed to

</I>&gt;<i> for JCA to be processed, create issue with ssh key, wait a long time for
</I>&gt;<i> ssh tunnel key to be added.  Do you see any way that the delays could be
</I>&gt;<i> reduced in the future?
</I>
	Yes - this is a pain; we're willing to accept someone's word in ooo-
build that someone has faxed / posted a JCA - and use cvs history to rip
their stuff out later in the (highly unlikely) event they are lying
through their teeth ;-&gt; [ never happened ].

	Unfortunately, our cvs account creation time is pretty bad now, since
the cvs.gnome.org attack binned the pretty web account creation
interface - a shame.

	Anyhow - enough waffle ;-) I've got patch back-porting to do.

	Regards,

		Michael.
