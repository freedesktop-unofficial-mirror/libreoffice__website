Subject: [Open Office] OOXML patches from xmlfilter02 cws is in, but...
Message-ID: <1184205586.2265.9.camel@kohei-hp.site>

Hi there,

Just so everybody knows, I've just committed a huge set of patches (284
of them) into the trunk that are a port of the upstream xmlfilter02 CWS.
They are in their own section [ OOXML ] in the apply file.

But these patches are not enabled yet due to a conflict with some of the
other patches, but I'm working on resolving the conflict as we speak.

Just a heads-up.

Kohei

As an update, the [ OOXML ] section now contains patches from the
writerfilter02 CWS as well.  All discovered patch conflicts have been
resolved (knock on wood ;-).  I have personally tested this against the
m220 source package (and several others have), but have not tested
against any source packages older than m220.  src-m220 is the current
default package.

Currently, [ OOXML ] is enabled for NovellBase only.

Just FYI.

Kohei

is there any new dependency or build-time dependency? i mean just
enabling that section is enough?

thanks,

Jolvan, you will have to have gperf installed, but that is build-time
dependency only and the configure will tell you about it loud enough :-)
