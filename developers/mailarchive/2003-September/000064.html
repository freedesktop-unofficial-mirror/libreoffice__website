<PRE>Hi Gwenole,

	So - I was just looking at the ooo-build ChangeLog, and I notice that
Martin K was adding back translated strings from patches you'd taken
from us and updated.

	This is really painful; looking further at your work I see that you are
(naturally) taking a lot of Ximian/Debian patches - and there will (of
course) only be (many) more over the (18month) lifetime of OO.o 1.1.

	Have you decided not to work with us for some (unknown) strategic
reason ? or would you consider working together with us ? we want to
make life as easy as possible so that you can. We have a common
patch-set, and an increasingly common build / runtime environment across
Ximian's platforms; RH/SuSE, and Debian Chris are also building their
packages from our set and working with us.

	If you see eg. <A HREF="http://ooo.ximian.com/patches/OOO_1_1_0/apply">http://ooo.ximian.com/patches/OOO_1_1_0/apply</A> you can
see how we currently sub-set the patches [ most of which we keep in
common ]. This ensures a uniform build across platforms.

	This is rather ruined by eg. if you don't like 'COMPATIBLE' as an
environment variable and change it to OOO_USE_MS_FORMAT_FOO [ as you
have done ] in one of your patches - we could share this cleanup instead
of confusing our users by creating multiple incompatible /
non-documented differences if we share the same set of patches in CVS.
[ a good change though :-].

	There are of course, multiple other benefits of working together - eg.
our improved language adaption stuff [ using LANG instead of doing
unsafe XML manipulations ], holding a flock while poking around at
~/.sversionrc [ etc. etc. etc. ] - too many things to even write out.

	It'd be _really good_ if you could commit to working with us; as a
condition of this it's necessary that Mandrake sign the JCA[1], and work
with us to up-stream all the changes responsibly. There is a sample
.spec file using ooo-build in CVS as well - getting you CVS commit
access is no problem; JCA notwithstanding.

	My feeling is that we can avoid lots of really, really tedious build &amp;
maintenance problems, better synchronize our patches and provide a much
nicer experience for all our users if we work together. You can checkout
ooo-build (including all our patches / icon fixing infrastructure etc.)
from Gnome anoncvs module 'openoffice'.

	Lets work together instead of duplicating (the most boring) tasks.

	Regards,

		Michael.
