Hi,
sorry for the delay, I've been visiting my parents over Easter [and they 
really need to get a better net connection ;) ].

True, maybe there's a need for src680-anything-before-m89 patch directories, 
or something akin to that. 

&gt;<i> 	I'm also concerned about the potential for regression moving so rapidly

</I>
I'm quite sure the new release additions aren't breaking anything or dropping 
patches by themselves, but there's definitely a potential for dropping 
patches when they get added to an older src-mXX when the newer src-mXX is 
already there...

&gt;<i> 	It's not really clear to me how to resolve this, particularly since you
</I>&gt;<i> seem to be rather far ahead of us - and building against unreleased
</I>&gt;<i> versions etc.
</I>
I can just do the newer stuff outside CVS and just commit it when needed, if 
that's what most ppl prefer.
The scripts I'm using here check OOo CVS for new src680_m.* tags and 
automatically create tarballs (and notify me) -- our plan ATM is to stay as 
close to the src680 branch as possible so we can go for 2.0 final as quickly 
as possible when it's released.

&gt;<i> 	One approach may well be (since currently ~everything is fairly static
</I>&gt;<i> compared to the minor point release updates eg. 1.1.3-&gt;1.1.4), to switch
</I>&gt;<i> to having a single 'apply' file; and then versioning / sub-setting
</I>&gt;<i> patches in a further way;
</I>
That definitely sounds good (but will probably also need different patch 
naming systems, given e.g. filter-nojava is still needed for m89, but needs 
to be slightly different in order to apply because unrelated parts of the 
makefile have changed in m89).


On another note, m88 seems to work pretty well except for mispainting 
checkboxes inside listboxes w/ the KDE VCL (e.g. Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; Language 
Settings -&gt; Writing Aids shows all the spellchecker options, but doesn't 
paint the checkboxes to actually make use of them (looks like they're 
0-width)).
Is anyone else seeing this?
