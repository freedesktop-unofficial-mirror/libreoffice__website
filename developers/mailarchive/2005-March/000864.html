<PRE>Hi,

I continued debugging the bridge. The last stack trace from Tuesday was
not very helpful, a NullReferenceException in internal Mono code that
processes return messages of remoting calls. Of course, my bug must have
happened earlier, but where? Didn't succeed in fixing that bug
yesterday. Started a build of m86 in the background.

More debugging today. Used the fact that a well-placed Console.WriteLine
could cause a crash in a different place, fixed that, and now the other
problem is fixed as well. There were several occurrences where I had
used typelib_TypeDescriptionReferences in a wrong way. The original code
had used C++ wrappers for them and I had used the bare C versions and
did not port the additional magic of the C++ wrappers.

Now the ViewSample.cs program has visible effect, it starts oocalc,
changes cell background colors, the grid color etc.

Next problem: a sigsegv in GC_mark_from :-/. But only in gdb.

Regards,

Martin
