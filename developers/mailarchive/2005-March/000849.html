<PRE>I'm trying to set up an old P2 for usage as a general computer for my mom
to use on the internet, do word processing, e-mail and such. I have a
hylafax server set up within the network that I'd like it to be able to
use from within xooo. Sounds easy, right?

Apparently not. Whenever I try to add a printer in spadmin that would print
to gfaxlpr (the gfax client for hylafax), it crashes with an illegal
hardware instruction.

Sometimes if I get far enough to &quot;finish&quot; the printer installation, the
printer is added (supposedly) but from that second on the entire suite of
programs crash with an illegal hardware instruction.

More investigation reveals that it does the invalid hardware instruction
dance not only when I am adding or have added a printer, but also when the
&quot;Font Configuration&quot; tab of the Generic Printer is selected.

I might mention that on the same server of hylafax I have CUPS running.
I was wondering if settings specified by spadmin are even _used_, because
the &quot;Generic Printer&quot; that spadmin displays is not visible in the printer
list, instead the printer on the CUPS server is there (CUPS:&lt;printername&gt;).

Now, I've read other things related to xooo claiming that spadmin is
obsolete. Tell me how so, if it is the only way to add a custom printer.
That's discussion for another thread I suppose; the current problem at hand
is why it's giving illegal hardware instruction. Maybe because it's trying
to use SSE[2] operations on a Pentium 2 that doesn't have such support? If
that's so, when was the decision made to stop supporting non-sse processors?

Hopefully that /isn't/ the case and this can be fixed.

Willing to help debug more if its needed.
