One option might be to try importing the branches into a more sophisticated 
version control system, such as baz (which is based on arch), that helps you 
by merging changes at the point they were authored, and then applying 
subsequent changes from other branches instead of trying to merge the branch 
heads together which we are effectively doing now.
