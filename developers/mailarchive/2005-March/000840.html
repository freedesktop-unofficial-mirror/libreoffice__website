<PRE>Hi,

I'm working on native parts of the bridge code (bridges/source/mono_uno)
now. Deleted some code that I had written before the C# bridge code and
replaced it with mono-specific code that calls into the managed bridge.

Decided to throw sample code (odk/examples/CLI) at it. And behold, uno
picked up my libcli_uno.so. It didn't do anything because some glue is
still missing. But it was cool to see that mono can generate a
meaningful stack trace although there were two transitions to native
code between the point where the terminating exception was thrown and
the Main method.

Now I implement the rest in the order that the mono runtime tells me to.
Already found some places where the C# method signatures had to be
adjusted for the real world.

Regards,
Martin
