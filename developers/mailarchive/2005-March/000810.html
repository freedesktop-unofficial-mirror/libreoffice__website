<PRE>Hi,

Status today,

The local validation build of presfixes01 is progressing; There were few
conflicts with the patches we have, so build had to be restarted and
hence the delay. 
So, got this huge patch committed into cvs:
ooo-build/patches/src680/cws-presfixes.diff

I've not added this to the apply file; Will do that once we have the
validation done, along with the changelog.

We may have to look for merging tools for more productive work when it
comes to integrating more and more cwses into ooo-build in this kind of
situation. It really becomes a tedious task otherwise.
Not sure if we have any such tool already; pls do let me know if any.
Also, was wondering if there is any option to make use of the cws tools
itself in someway to be used for local workspaces as well. A quick
search on those lines didn't yield anything though.

thanks,
-Nicel.
