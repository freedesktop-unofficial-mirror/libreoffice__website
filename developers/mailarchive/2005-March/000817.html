I forgot to mention that cscvs <A HREF="http://wiki.gnuarch.org/moin.cgi/cscvs">http://wiki.gnuarch.org/moin.cgi/cscvs</A> is
a CVS to arch archive convertor/mirror script/whatever

I don't know if Chris was thinking of arch that way, but I was thinking
not of a static snapshot, but one where at least all open (+ recently
integrated?) CWSs are available as arch branches. That way one could
(depending on how good arch's merging really is, I never used it in
multi-person projects ;-)) use the usual arch commands to

 * start from some milestone

 * take one build-fix patch from pj42

 * merge in vcl501

 * merge some branches representing ooo-build changes

 * later update to a new milestone that has integrated pj42 with no
conflicts (yeah, right. But at least there won't be a conflict because
of that build-fix patch, because arch keeps track of changes that you
already have from one branch and doesn't try to merge these again)

For that to work, the information &quot;CWS foo resynced to m42&quot; must somehow
get into arch, e.g. the cscvs could be patched to recognize &quot;RESYNC&quot;
commit messages (are these machine generated or just convention?)

But maybe I'm just smoking crack.

Regards,

Martin
