<PRE>Hi there,

	So - your filter-nojava thing is a bit of a pain - to be checked in so
many times.

	I'm also concerned about the potential for regression moving so rapidly
[ &amp; haphazardly ] between releases - I'm certain that we're dropping
patches &amp; breaking older versions.

	Traditionally, we have made one branch build really well, and then
stepped forward - keeping only ~1 buildable, and one scratch milestone.

	It's not really clear to me how to resolve this, particularly since you
seem to be rather far ahead of us - and building against unreleased
versions etc.

	One approach may well be (since currently ~everything is fairly static
compared to the minor point release updates eg. 1.1.3-&gt;1.1.4), to switch
to having a single 'apply' file; and then versioning / sub-setting
patches in a further way;

eg.

[ TemporaryHacks:src680-m8[4567] ]

	or somesuch - such that we can have a single apply file for all of
these versions, add new work in a way that is not horribly error prone,
and track rapid version changes without issues.

	How does that sound ? [ of course, I'll need to do the work at some
stage but ... ;-]

	Regards,

		Michael.
