using cygwin or unix cvs command run this command line in the source
directory where you changed the code:

cvs diff -u &gt; ~/patch.me

Which will create a difference patch on any file change in a reasonably
nice format in your home directory (~) called patch.me, change this is
you like.  You can browse this file to check whether it has what you
want in it.  Then you create and issue and attach it to that issue.
