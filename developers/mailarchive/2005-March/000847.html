<PRE>Hey,

* Worked on #66809 in b.i.n.c. A nasty Impress Crasher.

* Wrote up a crude patch that fixes that along with Jayant.

* Checked up some dictionary not working issues on Suse 9.3. Turned out
the dictionaries dont work if u remote login to the machine and only in
writer too ;-O

* Checked if the mime Oasis mime types worked on Suse 9.3. It works fine
but Suse 9.3 by itself had some mime issues. Requested Nagashree to file
a bug.

* Worked on #71931. A spell check crasher on Impress. Tried replacing
Suse installed libraries with libraries from my system hoping its some
installation issue. It still crashed though. Rambled on reasons with no
success.

* Dug up on some Indent patch i had worked on and upstreamed. To realise
it had some interoperability issues.

* Showed the entire team how to use the NovellTeam auto text ;). Nice to
see everybody happy with the photograph. 


p.s: The Indian Status reporting just belated not lost !


Cheers,
Shreyas
