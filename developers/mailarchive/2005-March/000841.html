<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE> - Was looking at the wizards crasher bug #10512/IZ#43665 chasing
EventListeners all over.

Had an invalid Window pointer to start with but no ISA function
available, tried to add it in with a TYPEINFO() and brought everything
crashing down. Shifted to plan B trying to print out the DECL_LINK to
get to the names of the EventHandlers actually registered to the Window,
but finally gave up after rebuilding every module that was dependent on
the tools/inc/link.hxx. Added in fprintfs printing out the Window and
EventHandler pointers and the number of EventHandlers, tracing out their
start and end points and eventually realized matching them up that the
EventHandler was called with a VCLEVENT_OBJECT_DYING, and was crashing
when invoked with an event beyond that, which should not have been
happening:

-       if ( pEvent &amp;&amp; pEvent-&gt;ISA( VclWindowEvent ) )
+       if ( mxWindow.is() &amp;&amp; pEvent &amp;&amp; pEvent-&gt;ISA( VclWindowEvent ) )
        {
                DBG_ASSERT( ((VclWindowEvent*)pEvent)-&gt;GetWindow(), &quot;Window???&quot; );
         if( !((VclWindowEvent*)pEvent)-&gt;GetWindow()-&gt;IsAccessibilityEventsSuppressed() || ( pEvent-&gt;GetId() == VCLEVENT_OBJECT_DYING ) )

Doesnt crash anymore :-)

The problem though, is that the pEvent was initialized/associated and
holds a pointer (copy) to its native Window, which is what is returned
by GetWindow() and by the time the EventListeners are called, the Window
doesnt exist anymore. So a check for NULL passes clean through.

Raul
