<PRE>Hi,

So, most of the time was spent on getting cws-impress34.diff merged
properly. This one was conflicting badly with some of the other impress
cws' we had integrated. 
Finally could resolve the conflicts and did a validation build as well.
Everything looks good so far. Once we have the build from Petr we can
have good QA on it.
Then, looked into the bugs; I feel with the new build, quite a few of
them should go away.
Another point is we need to think about the criteria that we apply to
decide upon on the severity/priority for the bugs and once decided
should follow that religiously. Not that we do a very bad job there, but
I feel we have room for improvement :-)

thanks,
-Nicel.
