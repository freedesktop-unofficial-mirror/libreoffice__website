<PRE>Hallo Peter,

I just followed your advices about GSI files and it works perfectly.
But I found one case where it doesn't work. Let's assume you have
distro-configs/ABC and you know, that you'll always build with
three languages only (en-US, cs, sk). So, you put these languages
in distro-configs/ABC and you start ./autogen.sh --with-distro=ABC
(without --with-lang, because they are in distro-configs/ABC). And now,
the GSI localization part doesn't work, because $OOO_LANGS_LIST
variable contains &quot;en-US&quot; only. Do you think it is worth to fix this,
invest time?

Next thing is, that I updated doc/extra-localizations.txt file.
Your advices are included.

And now, an idea how to translate new ooo-build features. I was
thinking about this issue for a while. This idea came to my mind.

1) For translators

There should be string freeze before new release of ooo-builds.
After the string freeze, POT file will be regenerated.

Translators can grab them, translate PO files (based on POT file)
and give them back.

POT file will be generated from all patches, scratches.

This is easy way for translators and easy way for ooo-build
maintainers.

2) Auto merging during build

Today's GSI file handling functions should be enhanced in this
way.

  o enhance stamp/build.extra.translations - add timestamp of GSI
    files and PO files

  o check for new GSI / PO files, their timestamps, and translate
    ooo-build build tree when new / updated file arrives

Any comments? Enhancements? It's just an idea which should be
finished. Do you agree with this? If yes, I'll implement this
idea into ooo-build.

Best regards,
Robert
