</I>
I see. It is doable. You would need to replace all occurences of 
OOO_LANGS_LIST with the variable WITH_LANG, which is defined in the OOo 
native profile (LinuxIntelEnv.Set.sh).

The variable OOO_LANGS_LIST is used in setup.in, build-ooo, ooinstall, and 
package-ooo. You can remove it from setup.in because it won't longer be used. 
The variable WITH_LANG will be available in the other locations, because the 
native profile is sourced there.

The only problem is the you would need to transform &quot;ALL&quot; to the real list of 
languages. I vote to do it in the config_office/*. Probably, the best place 
would be config_office/set_soenv.in. I think that you can use the same hack 
that is used in setup.in to generate OOO_LANGS_LIST.

In fact, I would prefere to remove solenv/inc/postset.mk and put the list of 
all languages into config_office/set_soenv.in. Though, it has to be dicussed 
with Sun people. They do not use the config_office module at all, so...

Note: We would like to merge ooo-build features into the upstream framework. 
My idea is to merge the configure options and variables, add our extra 
scripts into the config_office module. So, I think that the proposed solution 
is a step forward, definitely.

&gt;<i> Next thing is, that I updated doc/extra-localizations.txt file.
</I>&gt;<i> Your advices are included.
</I>
Looks nice!

&gt;<i> And now, an idea how to translate new ooo-build features. I was
</I>&gt;<i> thinking about this issue for a while. This idea came to my mind.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) For translators
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There should be string freeze before new release of ooo-builds.
</I>&gt;<i> After the string freeze, POT file will be regenerated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Translators can grab them, translate PO files (based on POT file)
</I>&gt;<i> and give them back.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> POT file will be generated from all patches, scratches.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is easy way for translators and easy way for ooo-build
</I>&gt;<i> maintainers.
</I>
Sounds great. The only problem is how to extrac/merge the po files from/to 
patches/sources.

I see two ways:

1. Create &quot;simple&quot; scripts that would work directly with patches
	+ advantages
		+ fast
	+ disadvantages
		+ I am a bit scared by syntax analyzer (diff of a source)

2. Use the existing localize tool:
	+ advantages
		+ probably more save way
		+ easier to maintain
	+ disadvantages
		+ you need to build the localize tool
		+ it takes a while to extract/merge many localizations
		+ the gsi file is quite a big

Well, I prefere the second solution:
	+ we will extract the strings only few times a year, so it does not matter if
          it is slow.
	+ We could create extra GSI files only with the ooo-build specific strings.
          It will be very small, quickly applied, ... It would be a bit tricky
          to locate the ooo-build specific strings. Though, it should not be
          so hard and we should do it anyway.

&gt;<i> 2) Auto merging during build
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Today's GSI file handling functions should be enhanced in this
</I>&gt;<i> way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   o enhance stamp/build.extra.translations - add timestamp of GSI
</I>&gt;<i>     files and PO files
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   o check for new GSI / PO files, their timestamps, and translate
</I>&gt;<i>     ooo-build build tree when new / updated file arrives
</I>
This is exactly what I thought about.

&gt;<i> Any comments? Enhancements? It's just an idea which should be
</I>&gt;<i> finished. Do you agree with this? If yes, I'll implement this
</I>&gt;<i> idea into ooo-build.
</I>
Sounds great. I am a volunteer for reviewing/testing your changes if you need 
it.


Best Regards,
Petr
