<PRE>Hi,

I was facing build prob in officecfg it was not getting xsltproc. I set
the XSLTPROC env and it works. I wonder if anyone faced this problem.

regards,
Amit

</I>Hi Anil / Amit,

	Hope you had a great Christmas break,

	I won't be back until the 5th, but I would like you two to be
working
from this Child Work Space (CWS) [cws_src680_vcl17] - I append my
instructions to Carl on how to check that out / build it.

	To do the file-selector and the evo. integration you're going to
need
to be using this branch - I'll back-port the changes into ooo-build
mid
Jan.

	My feeling is - that the difficult issues are mostly solved with
this
branch that you might have hit, so you should be able to get something
working quite nicely :-)

	HTH,

		Michael.

Hi Carl,

	Perhaps not; let me try and help you.

	Ok - the problem is that this 'cws' is in fact a nasty mess of
tags
from CVS; and won't really build easily for you from CVS either; I'll
come up with a more step-wise approach to getting it to work, and a
biggish patch to apply to your checkout.

&gt;<i> PS. Since you asked: Yes, the reply-to munging on this mailing list
</I>&gt;<i> does drive me nuts. I very nearly sent this to message to the whole
</I>&gt;<i> list rather than just to you.
</I>
	Crazy 'collab.net' I'm afraid; and totally unfixable. The people
who
should least be posting, post hundreds of mails, and don't want to see
the volume of their crime come-back into their inbox ;-)

&gt;<i> So, what do I need to do to start from that branch?
</I>
	So; you need to do something like this:

	export
CVSROOT=:pserver:<A HREF="mailto:anoncvs@anoncvs.services.openoffice.org">anoncvs@anoncvs.services.openoffice.org</A>:/cvs 
	cvs login &lt;enter&gt;
	mkdir cws_src680_vcl17 ; cd $_
	cvs -z3 checkout -r SRC680_m15 OpenOffice

	That grabs the base checkout; then you need to do:

	cvs -z3 upd -r cws_src680_vcl17 dtrans framework officecfg
solenv vcl

	Having done that you want to apply the attached patch to
everything.

	Then do:

	cd config_office
	./configure --enable-libart --enable-libsn --disable-java
	cd ..
	. ./LinuxIntelEnv.Set.sh
	./bootstrap
	dmake

	... sit back and wait ... hopefully you have a 'normal' looking
gcc -
right ? :-) when it's finished grok the hackers guide again.

	You might also benefit from the detailed hackers guide here:
		<A HREF="http://ooo.ximian.com/detailed-build-guide.html">http://ooo.ximian.com/detailed-build-guide.html</A> 

	To install from instsetoo I used an autoresponse file like
this:

[ENVIRONMENT]
INSTALLATIONMODE=INSTALL_NORMAL
INSTALLATIONTYPE=STANDARD
DESTINATIONPATH=/opt/GTInstall
OUTERPATH=
LOGFILE=
LANGUAGELIST=&lt;LANGUAGE&gt;

	in /tmp/autoresponse.conf then:

	cd instsetoo/unxlngi4.pro/01/normal/
	./setup -net -v -r:/tmp/autoresponse.conf

	Then you should be able to run /opt/GTInstall/soffice with
impunity.
After you do a linkoo, the devel loop is very tight (mercifully) this
is all
1st time pain.

	For help; head down to #OpenOffice.org, or #ooogtk on
irc.freenode.net
when it all falls apart.

	It'd be great to have you looking at this; unfortunately, there
are
some bits in the underlying API that don't lend themselves to a
pleasant cairo
implementation: copyArea, XOR stuff etc. I think it'll only make sense
for
XRender capable displays, however - we can easily detect that and
run-time link
in a separate Cairo module if that's the case.

	Regards,

		Michael.
