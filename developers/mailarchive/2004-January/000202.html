<PRE>Hi guys,

	Just a quick reminder; if you havn't read
<A HREF="http://ooo.ximian.com/ooo-build.html.">http://ooo.ximian.com/ooo-build.html.</A> Particularly for patch creation
we've had a number of blunders recently.

	Firstly - for the common case; small diffs : you should use
openoffice/bin/re-root on your tree - then you can simply do 'cvs diff
-u' in a given directory. NB. the path needs to be from the toplevel, so
it's best to do:

	cd OOO_1_1_0 # (eg.)
	export CVSROOT=`cat moz/CVS/Root` # if not set
	cvs diff -u vcl/source/foo/baa.c | tee -a the-patch-file.

	the tee -a lets you see the diff as it scrolls past, and appends to the
file.

	Now - for completely new files it is necessary to do:

	diff --new-file -u /dev/null vcl/source/foo/newbaa.c | tee ...

	This will create a unified diff that creates that file.

	Problems (and tedium) arises from people doing copies, and manual
diffs.

	Lastly - when you're editing a .diff - it's important to realise that
what may appear to be a blank line is in fact a crucial part of the
diff.

	Thus be _very_ careful when manually concatenating diffs. Since a
unified diff is highly tolerant of random whitespace, if in doubt add a
few newlines between sections :-)

	HTH,

		Michael.
