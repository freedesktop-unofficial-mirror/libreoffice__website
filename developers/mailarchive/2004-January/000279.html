	So - this is perhaps even more broken than I thought; people need to
filter on the 'Sender:' header; and your mail agent should know who you
are and auto-remove you from the CC: line if you're replying to
something. [ I guess that is where the lame-o problem lurks ;-]

	Failing that - a small patch to allow evolution to configurably ignore
known-broken mailing lists with a bogus 'Reply-To:' header might work
for me. I mean - should it up to the mailing list to mandate the policy
of people replying to it - making it nastily difficult to do anything
else ? I suspect not. Also - discouraging 1-to-1 communication while it
may initial seem an &quot;amazing community building&quot; idea is totally broken,
leading to less 1-to-1 relationship building, so - in summary the whole
&quot;Reply-To:&quot; header thing seems broken to me ;-&gt;

	Regards,

		Michael.
