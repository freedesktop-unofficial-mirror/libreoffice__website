<PRE>I think my main beef is that if people just hit reply with the
ximian-openoffice list, and forget to take my name off the To field, then
I get two copies of each message that gets sent.  That means more work for
_me_, whos reading the email, to figure out which copy is the non-list
copy, and delete that one.  Instead of making it easier to read mail, it
makes it more of a pain to manage the email since I have twice as many
messages to read, and then the extra steps of deleting the duplicates.  It
just seems like a nasty hack to fix somebody's lame-o problem with not
reading the To/CC fields before sending out personal email, then
overreacting.
