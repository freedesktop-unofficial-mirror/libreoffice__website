<PRE>Well,

	So - Petr &amp; I have implemented the discussed apply changes -
re-organised the source, tried to unwind the brokenness to m89; kendy &amp;
Petr are trying to fix m90.

	What is of the greatest concern to me is the potential for regression
here; a lot of patches got removed from m79; many patches got rather
hap-hazardly forward ported &amp; just plonked into m8*. The apply file is
riddled with unresolved FIXMEs.

	For us to be confident that we havn't lost anything valuable, I think
we're going to have to go back, diff vs. m79 and carefully look over
every single patch that has been dropped / changed.

	This is a huge chunk of effort. I don't want to have to do it again in
2 milestones time.

	Thus - I think it'd be by far the best if either:

	a) we ensure that we have a regression-free &amp; complete pull-up
	   to a given milestone before commencing work on the next 
	   milestone - ie. no FIXMEs, careful review of which patches
	   are no longer necessary, clear rational for removing them 
	   etc. After the pull-up we do a check-point release / tag.

	or

	b) people who want to race ahead for whatever reason do their
	   work on a branch &amp; we can review / adopt it as/when we move
	   HEAD to the next branch.

	I'd personally prefer a). We should (most likely) complete that work on
the m90 branch - I'm trying to get m89 to build now - since some people
on slow links who have suffered a lot of pain recently - happen to have
that archive downloaded. Of course, the initial work getting m90 back
into a sensible state may take a week or so - if so, we may jump to m92
- this would be no tragedy though.

	The new apply file lives in patches/src680/apply, the syntax extension
should be obvious from reading it - it's like this:

[ NovellOnly, RedHatOnly &lt; src680-m79 ]   or:
[ NovellOnly, RedHatOnly &gt; src680-m79 &lt;= src680-m89 ]  etc.

	Thanks,

		Michael.

PS. commit messages should have the relevant ChangeLog entry in them by
convention.
