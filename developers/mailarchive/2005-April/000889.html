<PRE>Hi,

When I was autotoolizing the bridge I was hoping, that Paolo could use
it with the 1.1 sdk package. It almost worked. But I wasn't able to
backport one function that's crucial for the demo programs :-(

Following a hint by Michael, I looked for other places than
mono_runtime_invoke as the source of my fatal mono thread warnings.
Turns out that I misunderstood what mono_thread_attach is for. It can
only be used in threads that the gc already knows about. The abort came
from there.

Started new builds of m88 (~same environment as Rene) to eventually have
some debs for Paolo. No luck with Rene's gij-4.0 patches. Made a build
with Sun Java. In the night to Friday, started a build of m89. Had to
make some gcc 3.3 build fixes. Segfaults during registration of java
components.

Regards,

Martin
