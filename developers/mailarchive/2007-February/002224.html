<PRE>Hi there,

	So - just some rules on changes to ooo-build - particularly relating
the the 'apply' file; I'm sure it's not just you Andreas doing this, but
you feature in the example.

	Firstly - the contents of 'apply' are *really* important, it is
critical that we don't let it get cluttered up with obsolete stuff
and/or difficult to identify stuff.

	Of course, I understand that sometimes people want to do quick hacks to
make things build, but then these need to be tagged; when I see eg.:

svn annotate apply
..
  8448    michael # more helpful VCL debugging
  8454    aprosky #vcl-debug.diff, i#72880, michael
  8448    michael 

	What do I learn ? why was vcl-debug disabled ? was this because we want
to keep the patch because it's still not up-stream, and further work is
required ? was it because someone wanted it to build in a hurry and
didn't bother to check ? etc.

	So - here is the mechanism that must be used for people in a hurry that
don't want to help :-)

	Please add &quot;FIXME&quot; to the line - if you don't understand what you're
doing; then we can quickly identify patches that have been explicitely
disabled by a maintainer for some (hopefully well-thought-through)
reason, and those that were quickly removed to adapt to a new version.

	Of course - in this case it is a shame: it is transparently obvious by
reading the patch &amp; the new source that the patch made it's way
up-stream intact. Even as a non-hacker you can verify this in the issue
&amp; EIS. In this case you need to:

	* remove all reference to the patch &amp; it's comment
	* svn remove the patch itself
	* add a ChangeLog entry describing it as obsolete
	* commit.

	Of course - it's necessary to have a fairly high certainty that this is
in fact now up-stream correctly, so this is best for slam-dunks :-)

	Anyhow - I hope that helps; /me is trying to unwind the find-unused
output to review all disabled patches to clean this up :-)

	Thanks,

		Michael.
