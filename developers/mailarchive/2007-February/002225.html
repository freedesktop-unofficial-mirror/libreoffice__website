<PRE>Another thing: Could we please make sure that when creating patches,
if at all possible, apply them on *all* platforms (and not just Linux
or just Win32)?

I.e. code patches should contain ifdefs if necessary to build on all
platforms, they should not be added to platform-specific patch sets in
the apply file.

Yes, I know, I have broken against this myself and put diffs that I
know are relevant only on Win32 into Win32Only patch sets, even though
it would not have caused any trouble at all to have the diffs in
question applied on Linux, too. (Either because the diffs touch files
that are built only on Win32, or changes are useful and good
cross-platform, or properly ifdeffed.)  I will correct that in trunk.

Having code patches properly ifdeffed as necessary is what's needed
anyway if the patch is supposed to go upstream.

Reducing the number of platform-specific patches will mean much less
trouble in the patch handling when patches depend on each others.
