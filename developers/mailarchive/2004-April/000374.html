<PRE>I'm looking through the ooo-build patches, and I've commited a small few of the
ww filter ones back to 112_fix and I see that a few more have made their way
into that series. But there are a few chunks without associated issuezilla ids
as far as I can see, i.e.

build-optimized-link.diff, changes solenv/inc/unxlngi4.mk to add -O2 and
-Bsymbolic to LINKFLAGS. Is there an OOo issuezill for that one ? (and do the
changes make a discernible difference :-)?)

There is already a -Wl,-O1 for linker flags in LINKFLAGSOPTIMIZE and -Bsymbolic
should probably be added to DYNAMIC, not that it makes any real difference, but
formats it in what I feel to be an more upstream acceptable patch.

C.
