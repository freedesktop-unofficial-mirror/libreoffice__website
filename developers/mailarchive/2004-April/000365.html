	This looks great; I guess we should file it up-stream, and make sure it
will in fact be accepted up-stream before we go too wild with it though;
also - I would suggest expanding the syntax slightly (possibly) to be:

moz  moz : solenv NULL #if(....)

	so that the polarity of the conditional is obvious; (with some suitable
delimiter I guess).

	also instead of (or as well as) 'chomp' it's useful to use:
s/\r\n//; since perl on win32 is flakey here.

	also; I guess it's prolly worth tolerating more sloppy whitespace about
the place eg.:

	#if ( ! CONDITIONAL )
	
	This is prolly best done with regular expressions eg.

	if ($condition =~ s/^\s*!\s*//) {
	}

	instead of the (more efficient) substr match [ plus changing
GetModuleBuildConditionals to allow whitespace inside () ].

	Also - I think you want to check for:

	if (!defined $ENV{$condition})

	otherwise it will spew warnings if the env. var is not set ( I think ).
I'd also use the ++ operator instead of += 1; and nest the
$ENV{$conditional} check to clarify the flow and avoid re-evaluation.

	It's slightly amazing that build.pl is well up for frequently
re-opening / parsing the same file :-) but I guess we should fit in with
that.

	Anyhow - modulo these trivial issues - this looks like a really nice
direction - it'll be great to bin excessive, repeated makefile.mk
patching - and the merge / patch conflicts we get there.

	I wonder though (idly) [ as one who can't build the odk cross-platform,
etc. ], whether conditionalizing dependant modules might work nicely eg.

	instsetoo instsetoo : ... moz.if(MOZILLA_ENABLED) ... 
				  odk.if(!WIN32) ...

	and/or whether that might have a similar effect; but I guess those
dependencies are perhaps duplicated in several other modules so I
suppose this way is best.

	Good stuff,

		Michael.
