Sorry for taking such a long time to respond.

I was actually thinking along the lines of additing conditional stuff
that did not need any patches at all.  I was thinking of using an
environment variable, passed through from configure/the *.Set file, that
would tell build.pl not to build the particular project.  E.g.

Say I had packaged libsal separately:

./configure --skip-projects=sal --without-mozilla

Might end up with this in the *.Set file:

SKIP_PROJECTS=&quot;sal moz&quot;

And build.pl would not run dmake in those projecs.  I hadn't thought
about per-directory specifications, but the syntax could be extended to
do that too.

There is maybe a use for both types of conditional build, depending on
what we are trying to achieve.  I was looking mainly for a way to split
the OOo build into several seperate pieces for the purposes of
packaging, which maybe doesn't fit so well with what Dan was thinking
of.

BTW, Dan mentioned problems due to several different code paths in
build.pl.  I had decided to add the new logic to 'module_classify',
which gets called from all paths as far as I can see.

Chris
