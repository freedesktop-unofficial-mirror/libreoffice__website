<PRE>Hi guys,

	So - I just spent an entertaining time unwinding a number of
not-altogether obvious issues :-) eventually VNC saved the day again -
since some of these are perhaps common problems I thought I'd write them
up:

* Using 'root'
	+ use the root account as little as possible
	+ use 'sudo' as little as possible

	If you find you are logged in as the root account; immediately log-out;
this is what 'sudo' is for ( setup /etc/sudoers to add the line:

	%wheel  ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL

	Then edit /etc/group to add yourself the wheel group:

wheel:x:10:&lt;add your name here&gt;

	+ Having setup sudo - Do not use it if at all possible -

* Using 'sudo'
	+ Do not do use 'sudo' if you can at all help it
	+ 'sudo ./soffice.bin' appears to run soffice.bin as root,
	  _But_ critically it drops your LD_LIBRARY_PATH before it
	  runs anything. A minute's thought shows you that allowing
	  the user to run random SUID programs with a new 
	  LD_LIBRARY_PATH would be a huge security hole.
		+ most soffice.bin execution requires a custom 
		  LD_LIBRARY_PATH

* How to avoid using root or sudo
	+ Change the ownership of directories / installs to be
	  owned by you: ie.
		sudo chown -R &lt;my-username&gt; &lt;directory&gt;
	   		(the '-R' implies a recusive change)
	+ If you have installed soffice as root, you may need to
	  copy across ~root/.sversionrc to your home directory,
	  NB. make sure you chown it.


	Another problem we saw was of soffice.bin zombifying itself; while
holding an flock on the services.rdb - meaning that we couldn't
subsequently register the file-chooser service [ with some cryptic
error ]; a move / copy of that would work fine.

	Anyhow - the take-home message - don't run anything as root; you'll
sooner or later either a) delete your file-system / trash your machine,
b) fall foul of some gross security hole, or c) fall foul of some subtle
security feature. Instead do everything as a normal user.

	HTH,

		Michael.
