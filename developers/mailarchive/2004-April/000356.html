<PRE>Hi,

There are a couple of problems with the deliver.pl script, none of 
which are insurmountable.  First, there are completely different 
codepaths for multiprocess builds and single-process builds (ie for 
-Px).  That makes it a bit hard to do one solution.  The second is that 
unless we include a full parsing engine in deliver.pl, we are limited 
to one conditional, which doesn't really scale well to ooo-build (but 
would be fine for my little project).

The advantage of this method over what I understand Chris' to be 
(correct me if I'm wrong) is that my method would allow for conditional 
building of directories _inside_ modules too, not just the whole module 
itself.  I'll keep hacking away and see what I get.  It might be 
sufficient to simply have a list of conditionals and assume that they 
can be OR-ed.
