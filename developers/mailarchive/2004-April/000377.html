	Well - no, the idea is that -Bsymbolic bins a load of symbols that
there is no need to make external, which might speedup linking - at
least; I think that's what it (might) do ;-) either way, it doesn't seem
to hurt - I think the functionality may be subsumed by some other
optimisation flags as well.

</I>&gt;<i> formats it in what I feel to be an more upstream acceptable patch.
</I>
	Oh; sounds most reasonable; go for it :-)

	Any others ? obviously we'd like to get as many up-stream as possible,
it's just a matter of time really. Any idea how long the 1.1.2 lifecycle
is ? and/or what branch to commit these to ? :-)

	Also - we have in the past tried to tag which patches are up-stream
already in 'apply' to save people effort doing further up-streaming
scans; if that's easy.

	Regards,

		Michael.
