I saw this in Dan's blog and assumed he had already his own
implementation:

        Spent some time today hacking on build.pl to enable conditional
        building of modules. There was some noise a while ago about a
        new build.lst format that would enable this in a flexible manner
        (ie build this directory on this arch but not others) but I
        can't seem to recall what came out of that besides a
        specification document.
        
        The reason I'm doing this is so that I can specify what modules
        don't need to get built for &quot;core&quot; office, avoiding modifying
        every .mk file in that module. That would be a pain.

Dan? :)

Chris
