	Excellent.

	Right - it's always nice to have something that works fast that we can
start testing / deploying now - even if it needs some degree of re-
working later.

&gt;<i> As of now what I am doing is going with the first option and trying to

</I>&gt;<i> user and password.
</I>
	Well - I think we should use the ldap stuff as the test-bed; clearly we
have to be able to cope with huge data-sets without fetching the whole
record set from the server :-) [ eg. bigfoot is not going to be ideal
for fetching all the records synchronously ] Is it possible that with
the same -&gt; File flow we can parse the incoming SQL request and build an
evolution query out of it ? NB. connectivity/source/drivers/mozab/
MStatement.cxx (parseSql) has some code that we could re-use to do this
[ is it in a sensible place for re-use ? ] - I guess since the Mozilla
driver handles LDAP as well, they hit the same problem.

&gt;<i> What are your suggestions ? 
</I>
	The file thing sounds good to start with - I'm looking forward to the
patch,

	Regards,

		Michael.
