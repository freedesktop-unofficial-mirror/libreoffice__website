<PRE>Hi,

I just thought i will update you on the task,

I have connected the code between evo-api and the driver, thus am able
to get the local evolution addressbook contacts without running the
evolution-addressbook-export command. Thus the flow is :

Statement.executeQuery -&gt; reads using LTable -&gt; reads from filestream
&lt;- evo-api writes to filestream. 

Thus the communication mechanism is UCB Filestream. With some more
tweaking dependency over command line tool can be completely removed. I
have added the uri parsing code as well, but it seems there is some
problem in the evo-api itself and it doesnt bring data from the
specified uri properly. I am into it now ;-)

The above is a cumbersome but fast option, the other alternative is to
completely rewrite the evoab driver code which as of now completely
depends on File driver code base. This is quite a bit of task. As it
will involve a good amount of coding.

As of now what I am doing is going with the first option and trying to
get the addressbook data of ldap,groupwise etc backend based on the uri,
user and password.

What are your suggestions ? 

regards,
Amit
