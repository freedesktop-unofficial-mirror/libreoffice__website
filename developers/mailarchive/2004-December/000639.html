<PRE>Hi!

 - Spent the day wading through Shells and Views and Docs and Nodes
wondering where I could get the graphic I needed in Writer from :-) Will
take more time to decipher...
 - Seems csc.exe is from the .NET Framework SDK which is supposed to be
installed on the machine, trying to skip csc.exe still goes on to stop
at mscoree.lib, which is at least present on the machine. So there seems
to be a mess-up.
 - Checked in the changes to configure.in to ooo-build-1-3, but not into
HEAD yet.
 - Hit a build issue where the machine had mozilla-devel, but no mozilla
installed, so the build breaks in libxmlsec when linking is attempted to
libnss3. The build log shows configure warning libnss3.so: No such file
or directory, but doesnt stop there. So that needs to be fixed.

Regards,
Raul
