	Jan's just back from vacation.

	;-)

&gt;<i> &gt; - it has to be experienced to be believed. So - it doesn't

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> OK. But do you still get your work integrated into &quot;official&quot; OOo at the end?
</I>
	Yes - well, that is - if you look at the patches/src680/apply file you
will see all the up-stream issue numbers those patches are filed
against. Of course - there is a huge gap between filing a fix &amp; actually
seeing it in a shipping product - with a release every 2 years - it can
be quite a tough process ;-)

&gt;<i> Speaking about shipping with OpenSUSE / Novell (you're a Novell guy, aren't

	Right - a tough call - sadly the feature freeze was ~3 weeks and
several betas ago; but I look forward to seeing it (in some complete
form) in 10.1.

&gt;<i> Ah, and I will subscribe to this list, if there are not too much

</I>
	Fairly low traffic indeed - fairly rare to have much E-mail at all
here.

	Regards,

		Michael.
