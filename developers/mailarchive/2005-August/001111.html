<PRE>Hi Eric,

	Ah - ok, that's fine then - as long as it's in the works we are happy
in ooo-build land :-)

&gt;<i> I still don't understand how ooo-build integrates with normal CWS system. And 
</I>&gt;<i> is ooo-build a kind of fork ?
</I>
	We don't say fork - it's a dirty word. It's a &quot;holding ground for
patches on their way up-stream&quot;. As you try to get your work up-stream
you will realise what a total PITA Sun makes it - creating unnecessary
pain at every stage - have you seen the 'specification' writing
process ? - it has to be experienced to be believed. So - it doesn't
really integrate with the cws system at all.

	Anyhow - the punch line is that - you can ship in
Debian/[Open]SUSE/Gentoo/Ark/PLT/etc. etc. quickly while Sun stews in
their own juice ;-)

&gt;<i> Besides that, I spent the day reading docs about the coding conventions (it 
</I>&gt;<i> gave me the occasion to fix a few nonconformant things) and reading the stuff 
</I>&gt;<i> on ooo-build's server.
</I>
	Ah - please do contribute to the wiki - we're trying to migrate all the
hackers guides / cws docs etc. &amp; build that out to:
<A HREF="http://go-oo.org/wiki/">http://go-oo.org/wiki/</A>

&gt;<i>  It allowed me to fortify my knowledge of the OOo build 
</I>&gt;<i> system. I wish I had discovered this doc before starting this project :-(. 
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway. It's great doc, thanks for having made it.
</I>
	Heh :-)

	Regards,

		Michael.
