<PRE>Le Mardi 23 Ao&#251;t 2005 16:44, michael meeks a &#233;crit&#160;:
&gt;<i> 	Jan's just back from vacation.
</I>
OK. Let's give him the time to empty his 2^2024 late emails ;-).

&gt;<i> &gt; OK. But do you still get your work integrated into &quot;official&quot; OOo at the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; end?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	Yes - well, that is - if you look at the patches/src680/apply file you
</I>&gt;<i> will see all the up-stream issue numbers those patches are filed
</I>&gt;<i> against.
</I>
Does this imply that you just attach files to issue reports and wait for them 
to be integrated by the Suns?

&gt;<i> Of course - there is a huge gap between filing a fix &amp; actually 
</I>&gt;<i> seeing it in a shipping product - with a release every 2 years - it can
</I>&gt;<i> be quite a tough process ;-)
</I>
Isn't 2.0.1 branch already open for new stuff?

&gt;<i> 	Right - a tough call - sadly the feature freeze was ~3 weeks and
</I>&gt;<i> several betas ago; but I look forward to seeing it (in some complete
</I>&gt;<i> form) in 10.1.
</I>
No problem, thanks for the feedback.

It will give time to add more features to the driver. There's a bit of work 
involved in adding more complex SQL expression parsing. You know, with a 
whole syntax tree of AND and OR nodes...
	SELECT * FROM addresses WHERE ( &quot;Family Name&quot; LIKE 'B%'
		AND &quot;Given Name&quot; Like &quot;&#201;ric&quot; ) OR &quot;Mobile Phone&quot; IS NULL

&gt;<i> 	Fairly low traffic indeed - fairly rare to have much E-mail at all
</I>&gt;<i> here.
</I>
Good ;-).

Is &#201;ric Bachard on this list ? If yes, there's no use to put him on the 
recipients list.
