&gt;<i> Hi Eric,
</I>
Hi Michael.

[Removing Cornelius and Jan from the recipients. Jan's mailbox is full - 
another effect of vacations time]

&gt;<i> &gt; I don't think so. I suppose my letter is in Sun's offices in the US,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; waiting for Eric Renaud to be back from vacation. We have already sent
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; him a mail.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	Ah - ok, that's fine then - as long as it's in the works we are happy
</I>&gt;<i> in ooo-build land :-)
</I>
;-)

&gt;<i> &gt; I still don't understand how ooo-build integrates with normal CWS system.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And is ooo-build a kind of fork ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	We don't say fork - it's a dirty word.
</I>
!!! At least I had one good laugh today!!! :-)

&gt;<i> 	It's a &quot;holding ground for 
</I>&gt;<i> patches on their way up-stream&quot;. As you try to get your work up-stream
</I>&gt;<i> you will realise what a total PITA Sun makes it - creating unnecessary 
</I>&gt;<i> pain at every stage - have you seen the 'specification' writing
</I>&gt;<i> process ?
</I>
I have seen samples of such documents, yes. I can figure out.

&gt;<i> - it has to be experienced to be believed. So - it doesn't 
</I>&gt;<i> really integrate with the cws system at all.
</I>
OK. But do you still get your work integrated into &quot;official&quot; OOo at the end?

&gt;<i> 	Anyhow - the punch line is that - you can ship in
</I>&gt;<i> Debian/[Open]SUSE/Gentoo/Ark/PLT/etc. etc. quickly while Sun stews in
</I>&gt;<i> their own juice ;-)
</I>
Understood.

Speaking about shipping with OpenSUSE / Novell (you're a Novell guy, aren't 
you?), see
	<A HREF="https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=103857">https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=103857</A>

&gt;<i> 	Ah - please do contribute to the wiki - we're trying to migrate all the
</I>&gt;<i> hackers guides / cws docs etc. &amp; build that out to:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://go-oo.org/wiki/">http://go-oo.org/wiki/</A>
</I>
Ooops. I meant &quot;on the wiki&quot;. Not on main server.

&gt;<i> &gt;  It allowed me to fortify my knowledge of the OOo build
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; system. I wish I had discovered this doc before starting this project
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; :-(. Anyway. It's great doc, thanks for having made it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	Heh :-)
</I>
Ah, and I will subscribe to this list, if there are not too much messages a 
day.
