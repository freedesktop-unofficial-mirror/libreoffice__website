<PRE>Hi there,

	Prolly best to discuss on the mailing list I guess - since almost
everyone is involved ;-) Also - IMHO it'd be best to start discussing
this sort of thing on the public list I think. Apparently Sun is less
annoyed than I thought about us working on this.

	Ok - I'm really looking for a more rigorous analysis of his files - ie.
script-generated frequencies of various property names etc. ie. getting
a good prioritisation here is important. Also - it shouldn't be
particularly hard to do - but perhaps Robert will help us with that.

	Some comments:

	1.2 - How we deal with these pseudo-methods like 'Cells' that
	      are clearly really just inherited from the 'ActiveSheet'
	      I don't know. I don't want to see lots of stubs / code
	      duplication here - I'd like a more elegant solution using
	      the introspection code.

	2.1 - similarly Worksheetfunctions - I do not want an IDL file
	      that duplicates loads of information available elsewhere
              we should dynamically generate that interface.

	8 - working with another application is deep, deep future - lets
	    not go there yet.

Misc tasks:

	1 - not clear what this is - why 'dynamically constructed 
	    object' ? do you mean 'custom worksheet function' ?

	2.2 - really blocks on Jody's re-write of the expression parser

	2.4 - what is missing wrt. Array support ?

	3.1 - Noel's piece

	3.2 - Is this -really- used ? I'd like some hard numbers there.

	3.3 - 'for each' doesn't work ?

	3.4 - I guess this covers a huge chunk of constants that we're 
              going to need - some fruitful IDL typing work there I 
              think.

	7 - is that a syntax issue ?

	8. is conceptually the same as 2.2

	9. - again - syntax ?


	It'd be great to see a re-worked version of this document. Also - I'd
like to see the results of the analysis of the data it's based on.

	Thanks,

		Michael.
