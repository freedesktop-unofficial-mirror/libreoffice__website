	I think they're not there, since it just uses glib/gobject anyway which
are everywhere.

	Ah ;-) an apply.pl improvement would be nice - particularly reverting
overlapping files recursively in the right order before re-applying
them. Of course - we read the entire patch to see if it's changed anyway
- so shouldn't be any less efficient to extract the list of files it
touches I think.

</I>
	It'll prolly be fine at runtime, UNO handles un-linkable components
quite well normally I think.

	Regards,

		Michael.
