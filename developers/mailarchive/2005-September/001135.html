The code compiles just when --enable-kde is used, so the build should not 
break.  I am not sure whether there are #ifdefs in the common code (e.g. the 
Address Data Source Wizard), but I think I did not see them for the Evolution 
code either; but I did not look too well, maybe it is solved another way.  
Eric, could you please comment on this?

What I meant by 'dependencies' was patching already patched files, like when 
file A is patched by patch X and then by patch Z.  If you change the patch X 
later, the unapply will most probably break.  I am working on an apply.pl 
improvement at the moment.

&gt;<i> 	Can we make sure that the KAB is disabled if the relevant libraries are
</I>&gt;<i> not there ?
</I>
I am not sure what is the behavior when OOo was built with the KDE support, 
but the system lacks the libraries at runtime; I'll check that.

Bye,
Jan
