	Well; OO.o _will_ ship with a built-in version of libwpd [ at least,
all the RH/SuSE packages will I think, Debian is a law unto itself ].
Certainly, until all the features we use are completely settled, and the
library has been boringly stable for 6 months or so I'd not want to have
libwpd external :-) so - this won't be a system library, but a private
internal one.

	Having said that, there are some psychological advantages to a 0.8.0
release; perhaps if there was numbering space for an unstable release
between 0.7.x and 0.8.x ;-&gt; we could have had a 0.7.95 release or
something.

&gt;<i> I was able to compare the performance of WriterPerfect as compared to

</I>&gt;<i> discovered that the CVS HEAD of WriterPerfect converts better (in terms 
</I>&gt;<i> of layout differences between original document and the result of the 
</I>&gt;<i> conversion) than the SO7 converter (even the international characters 
</I>&gt;<i> are converted better by us)
</I>
	Nice ! :-)

&gt;<i> ; nonetheless, for WP5x and WP3 for Mac, the 
</I>&gt;<i> proprietary converter is better. Not for long time though. We are trying 
</I>&gt;<i> hard to make it as good as WP6+ :-)
</I>
	Cool.

&gt;<i> I would not mind to be able to commit too, if it is possible ;-) Sending 
</I>&gt;<i> patches and waiting for them to be applied can slow down/discourage the 
</I>&gt;<i> work and also adds supplementary work-load for the administrators.
</I>
	Yes - we should get that sorted out; I'm sure Martin will contact you
to get ssh keys setup etc.

	Great to see this startint to move, and get the great work you guys
have been doing more widely deployed to the the hungry hordes :-)

	Regards,

		Michael.
