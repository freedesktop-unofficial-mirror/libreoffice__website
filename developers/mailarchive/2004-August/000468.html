When in Sun I ran libwpd through the appropiate ass-covering process
so libwpd and dependancies like libgsf should be ok as a LGPLed component. 
AMA is interested in this btw, so you could cc him on a child workspace 
creation and progress.

For what its worth I seem to recall that MBA was interested in how libgsf 
would play out as a replacement for the equivalent parts of so3/sot.
