<PRE>Hi Daniel,

	No idea about this - but this missing feature is hurting OO.o's use of
xsltproc to the extent that people are considering using something else
(which is prolly a mistake for other reasons).

	Since I know nothing about the issue - what is the deal with
import/uses constructs ? are they that much of a pain to implement ?

	Thanks,

		Michael.

</I>&gt;<i> I have been working on getting OOo 1.9.x to build without usage of a

</I>&gt;<i> Issue #32143).  Up until now, we have concentrated on fixing build
</I>&gt;<i> problems by reimplementing essential build tools written in Java: 
</I>&gt;<i> Officecfg has used xsltproc, and Dan wrote a Python script for
</I>&gt;<i> fcjmerge.   Now I have the problem that xsltproc does not support the
</I>&gt;<i> XML Schemas Part 1 specification, and I have to pick one of the
</I>&gt;<i> following choices:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Rework the XML source not to use the import/uses constructs.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is possible, but would involve duplicating parts of the schema, or
</I>&gt;<i> using some sort of preprocessing of the input files.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Find another parser that implements the spec
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> xalan could perhaps be used.  It is part of the same project that is
</I>&gt;<i> used for the Java based processing.  I tried xalan out, but had similar
</I>&gt;<i> errors as seen with xsltproc.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Add a dependency on a (free or non-free) JDK for all builds
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The officecfg and fcjmerge projects already build successfully with free
</I>&gt;<i> JDKs such as gcj or Kaffe.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As part of the conference call about supporting free JDKs with OOo, all
</I>&gt;<i> present agreed that it would be acceptable to introduce core features
</I>&gt;<i> that depend on Java, as long as they do not use interfaces that are not
</I>&gt;<i> yet implemented in free JDKs.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have already spent a lot of time looking at these problems in
</I>&gt;<i> officecfg and playing catch up in these projects, and I would like to
</I>&gt;<i> consider requiring a JDK to compile and run these build-time modules so
</I>&gt;<i> I can spend the time I have on something more useful instead.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So I would like to propose introducing a JDK dependency for m50, for a
</I>&gt;<i> JDK that is able to compile and run these Java modules at a minimum,
</I>&gt;<i> without having to support the full Java UNO.   
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is anyone aware of a platform that does not have a suitable gcj or kaffe
</I>&gt;<i> implementation, that would be adversely affected by this?  What is the
</I>&gt;<i> situation with Windows?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
