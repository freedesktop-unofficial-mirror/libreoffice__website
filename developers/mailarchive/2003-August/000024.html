	Well - it seems to me there will always be features that work well for
one platform (Unix, Mac, Gnome) etc. that have possibly detrimental
effects on the other platforms.

	Thus - it makes sense to have patches separated; eg. looking at my
existing patch-set (most of which are filed in bugzilla, see the #
numbers in RC3_030729/apply eg.) some of the patches are Linux specific
and no-brainers eg. not doing hundreds of sched_yields - just in case
someone is using green-threads (see #9277 for a much lamer fix).

	Others are simply festering in IZ - un-commented on, or with
ultra-conservatives behind them ;-) yet others are not done prettily -
eg. the alpha blending work is not done in a robust way - it happens to
work - but it's not suitable for folding up-stream until we have a
decently scalable alpha-rendering API - that I have yet to even look at.

	So - it seems to me, that for the foreseeable future it will be
necessary to fairly heavily patch OO.o for virtually all distributions -
and it's likely that this problem will get worse and worse during the
lifetime of OO.o.

	Anyway, that's my thinking - as it stands, of course - the other nice
thing about a separate patch-set like this is that it can (perhaps)
centralise the myriad slightly differently buggy hacks that people wrap
OO.o with (cf. the differences in wrapper scripts for Mdk, RH, Debian,
Ximian eg.) - thus saving work, and reducing confusion [ I hope ].

	HTH,

		Michael.
