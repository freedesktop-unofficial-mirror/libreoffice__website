<PRE>Hi Nick,

	Um; then your gcc is corrupt most likely ... what precisely does
configure say ? can you post the output of the section around the
problem. Are you sure you have no gcc aliases ?

&gt;<i>  I dont know maybe I need to check my MD5 of the

</I>
	I believe there were md5sums on ooo.ximian.com/packages at one stage; I
get:

30486e90a22d0693e3c1c2c2fc334dc9  src/RC3_030729.tar.bz2

	It would be great to add an md5sum checker to the 'download'
perl-script if you had time for that [ shouldn't be too hard ].

&gt;<i> I have some other people trying to build it also and they are getting
</I>&gt;<i> totally diffrent compile errors.  Mostly theirs are stopping when it
</I>&gt;<i> tries to compile the mozilla stuff.
</I>
	HEAD doesn't compile any mozilla bits; I'd use that instead.
	
&gt;<i> Anyway for now I am going to try building gcc again and compiling with
</I>&gt;<i> it to see what happens using the script from HEAD.  Thanks for all the
</I>&gt;<i> help.
</I>
	No problem; hopefully we'll get you up and running and our process more
bullet-proof as we go along,

	Regards,

		Michael.
