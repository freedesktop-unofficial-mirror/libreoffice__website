Sleeping in Issuezilla:

  002_dmake_tempnam.diff: IZ#7800 waiting for your approval
  906_set_gnome_menu_right.diff: IZ#11738
  041_sv_HTML_typo.diff: IZ#16437, no reaction since I filed it.

Specific problems caused by our packaging:

  011_stlportlink.diff: use system libstlport, would break setup on .tar.gz
			installs
  901_disable_langcheck.diff: Makes no sense for non langpack setups
  902_remove_rpaths.diff: Debian insists on no rpaths but these have been
			  recently added, I haven't worked out why yet.


Not yet ready for submission:

  021_SAL_DEBUG.diff: I'm not happy enough with the names of the vars to
		      submit
  022_config_switches.diff: Incomplete (not yet fully implemented)
  024_system_python.diff: Incomplete (strange renaming of libraries, I need
				      to discuss this first)
  025_aclocal_update.diff: Only needed to support 022 and 024

  032_select_instsets.diff, 033_scpzip_dontpackswitch.diff: Incomplete,
	  michael had a look at these last week so maybe ready now.

  905_remove_lzwc.diff: Incomplete (no configure switch)

Compare that to &gt; 50 patches that are already integrated from our work over
the past 18 months.

Plus, where am I supposed to put things?  I don't know of an open branch for
anything other than 1.1, and that is frozen for anything but severe bug
fixes.

I also still need a mechanism to apply patches for fixes that are in CVS but
not yet in the particular release/branch that we are building from.
