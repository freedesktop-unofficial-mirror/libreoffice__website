	Ah ! ;-) well - you fell foul of the fact that I've never tested the
OOO_1_0_3 install using these ooo-build package ;-) since we went
public, I've abandoned maintaining that stuff since it's rather
uninteresting.

	Try building the RC3_030729 [ just a simple configure with no arguments
is good ], that should work better; also, I'm about to announce a new
release - I'd play with that instead.

&gt;<i>  it

</I>&gt;<i> print-1.0.3.1-fix.diff from /patches/OOO_1_0_3, but
</I>&gt;<i> the file is actually there.
</I>
	Ah ;-) ok, I'll add a patch path to that file in CVS; which is what is
missing, but we'll prolly bin that patch set completely shortly it's not
intended to work; RC3 is far better in every respect already.

&gt;<i> 0. Install the downloaded Java SDK nor other files

</I>&gt;<i> re-run ./configure &amp;&amp; make, but i think it'll be the

</I>
	Yes; sure gcc,jdk,binutils should all be built/installed by the build
process :-)

&gt;<i> can you give me a hand with this?
</I>
	As above really; you'd do best to checkout the new release.

	HTH,

		Michael.
