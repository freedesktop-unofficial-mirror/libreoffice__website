Hi Jerome,

Michael talked to me last week about his idea to use the same common
patchset and packaging scripts.  His suggestion is for us to use the same
patch directory, with a mechanism to select which of the packages are
actually applied.

The idea is for our packages to use his scripts to apply the patches instead
of the modified dbs we currently have.  So we would add the existing
Debian-only patches into Michael's directory, and probably stop using
debian/patches.  The remaining patches can be converted to -p0 format.

Miachel created the mechanism for us to tag the patches that we want to
include/exclude, now it is up to us to decide what to include.

&gt;<i> I don't quite see why Ximian should do Debian-specific parts, and as I

</I>&gt;<i> desktop-friendliness.
</I>
The Debian-specific mechanism that Michael added was for the Debian team,
not for himself.  It is for us to decide which patches we will include in
our packages.

Chris
