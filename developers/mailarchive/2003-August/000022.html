This one looks OK, why hasn't it gotten through, Ken?  (I know everyone 
gets busy at times though...)  Are you worried about side-effect?  I 
did double-check to make sure that $(mktemp $(TMPFILE)...) wasn't used, 
and its not.  However, we need to make sure people know this if this 
feature is finally disabled.

Are there really supposed to be two &quot;,,&quot; after the $lang in the 
replacement line here?  If these &quot;,,&quot; are valid, can you pass a NULl 
value or something to indicate that its not really a typo?  Other than 
that, most of the changes are spacing, but I'm not really qualified to 
approve :)

&gt;<i>   041_sv_HTML_typo.diff: IZ#16437, no reaction since I filed it.
</I>
Approved.

&gt;<i> Plus, where am I supposed to put things?  I don't know of an open 
</I>&gt;<i> branch for
</I>&gt;<i> anything other than 1.1, and that is frozen for anything but severe bug
</I>&gt;<i> fixes.
</I>
This one is a bit tricky, since there are any number of branches open 
at one time of course.  Make sure you get things in HEAD and the 
current master workspace (mws), otherwise the chance they will not get 
into successive branches is greater, since they might get missed in a 
merge.  I know Martin and Heiner try not to miss stuff, but invariably 
it happens.  After HEAD, whatever is the next branch for release.  In 
this case, IZ#16437 would have been a great candidate for any 1.1 RC 
branch.  Sometimes it takes perseverance and a bit of yelling and 
prodding to get something in.  For example, I'm happy to approve and 
commit small chunks of code that I can easily verify as being correct, 
like IZ#16437.  But around release time it gets a lot harder, and since 
RC3 may already be closed these bugs might have to get punted til 1.1.1.

&gt;<i> I also still need a mechanism to apply patches for fixes that are in 
</I>&gt;<i> CVS but
</I>&gt;<i> not yet in the particular release/branch that we are building from.
</I>
As long as the patches get into the main branches (ie HEAD, current 
mws, and the next-release branch) they should get merged periodically 
to other branches.  If not, then you have to speak up and get them 
merged or approved and applied.  I know this takes a bunch of work on 
your part (and believe me, I'm no stranger to unmerged patches), but 
until the patch/approval process gets even _more_ streamlined, that's 
how it is :(

Again, if you need patches approved, post on the dev@ lists and I or 
others can approve or at least post comments to the patch on how to 
improve it.  I've found out that you really can't rely on the default 
person IZ assigns a new issue to, because they usually have a ton of 
work to do.  People like me on the other hand don't have that much and 
therefore you can get a much quicker turnaround time from us.
