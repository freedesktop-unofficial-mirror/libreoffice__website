Yeah I saw that in HEAD and tried using it.  So far it doesnt work.  The
configure script in config_office tells you that your gcc is corrupt,
then bombs out.  That part I dont understand because my gcc isnt corrupt
being I compile every single app on my box.  Glad you could use that
though.

Yeah I dont know either.  I will take another look at it and test
again.  It did actually build 1 time for me when I 1st tried to compile
it, but the default compiler opts use -mpentiumpro and being I have a
Althon-XP I wanted to recompile for it.  Well I have tried
-mcpuathlon-xp, -mcpui686 and back to -mcpupentiumpro and all fail at
the same point.  I dont know maybe I need to check my MD5 of the
source.  Can you give me the MD5 of the 20030729 source just to make
sure?=20

I have some other people trying to build it also and they are getting
totally diffrent compile errors.  Mostly theirs are stopping when it
tries to compile the mozilla stuff.

/usr/src/ooo-build-1.1.35/build/RC3_030729/connectivity/source/drivers/moza=
b/mozillasrc/MDatabaseMetaDataHelper.cxx:210: warning: `const char*kPropert=
yName' defined but not used
dmake:  Error code 1, while making
'../../../../unxlngi4.pro/slo/MDatabaseMetaDataHelper.obj'
---* TG_SLO.MK *---

ERROR: Error 65280 occurred while making
/usr/src/ooo-build-1.1.35/build/RC3_030729/connectivity/source/drivers/moza=
b/mozillasrc
dmake:  Error code 1, while making 'build_all'
---* TG_SLO.MK *---
make[1]: *** [all] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/ooo-build-1.1.35/bin'

I dont know if you could help with that or not, but I might suspect a
bad source file again I dont know.

Anyway for now I am going to try building gcc again and compiling with
it to see what happens using the script from HEAD.  Thanks for all the
help.

Nick
