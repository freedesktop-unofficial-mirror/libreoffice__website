Indeed IMHO what we need is a common policy for font name aliasing (either in importing
and export), which to me appear a little bit confused. For instance in the past,the OOo 1.1.X, 
it was honouring the fonts.dir files, so if one was providing a fonts.dir file with entries for 
different font names mapping to other Type1 fonts (with a different /FontName) that fonts could 
be part of the font recognized by OOo.
Right now in OOo 2.0 this behaviour seems to be lost, so when importing
files with font used from other OS, the name mapping is often ugly (basically
it fallback to Vera or DejaVu), or it's only available for viewing but not for composing. I 
explain with an example: in the past if I was using a fonts.dir file (in a font path reachable 
by OOo), with entries like:

019003l.pfb -URW-Helvetica-medium-r-normal--0-0-0-0-p-0-iso8859-1

then the Helvetica font was available in the Font menu of OOo, and one
could compose text using that &quot;Helvetica&quot; font exactly like as if it was real &quot;Helvetica&quot;
font. This was useful when exporting files to other OS which might have the
Adobe proprietary fonts.
Now what was needed, is that just the file &quot;019003l.pfb&quot; (Type1 font)
and 019003l.afm (font metric file) were existing in the same fontpath of fonts.dir.
Note that the 019003l.pfb is indeed the font URW &quot;Nimbus Sans L Regular&quot;,
but due to the above fonts.dir entry, OOo was showing it in the font menus also as
&quot;Helvetica&quot; nevertheless the internal PostScript &quot;/FontName&quot;
was &quot;NimbusSansL-Regu&quot;.

Right now the URW free family font might be a good replacement for all the Adobe Standard
35 fonts, but in OOo 2.0 this behaviour seems changed and it's no longer possible to use
URW for providing the whole replacement for the Adobe Standard 35 fontset.

Bye
Giuseppe.
