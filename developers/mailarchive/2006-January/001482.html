<PRE>Hi all

I've started looking at integrating the sil graphite patch into ooo-build

This is just for interest, I've stripped the actual patch and logfile 
but they're at <A HREF="http://davidf.sjsoft.com/files/ooo-build/">http://davidf.sjsoft.com/files/ooo-build/</A>

For more information on the project, see:
<A HREF="http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&amp;item_id=OOo_20_graphite">http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&amp;item_id=OOo_20_graphite</A>
<A HREF="http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&amp;item_id=OOo_20_source">http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&amp;item_id=OOo_20_source</A>

Tim Eves is the maintainer and he's wanting to get this into OOo CVS so 
I suggested using ooo-build

There's currently a problem with gcc4 and sil graphite though

Cheers
David

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Well the first would be to try a build using ooo-build. The wiki at

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'd love to help with the integration, so I'll see where you're at when 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I get back from holiday.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> By the way, I couldn't see a link to the sil-graphite-1.1.2.tar.gz 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that's included in the patch on the Graphite site, is it available 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> publicly somewhere?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i> There are 2 versions of the Graphite API, both use essentially the same
</I>&gt;<i> underlying engine code.  The patches currently use v1 and shall be moved
</I>&gt;<i> to v2 early in Jan.  Please note that the tarball is embedded in the
</I>&gt;<i> patch file so there is no need to download it, the oo module also
</I>&gt;<i> includes a patch file.  Part of the reason this patch is a bit of mess
</I>&gt;<i> is that it was put together quite quickly in time for the recent WSIS.
</I>&gt;<i> The CVS head and the included OO version are out of sync as some recent
</I>&gt;<i> checkins to broke the Linux build in an attempt to fix gcc4.0 issues.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Right, ooo-build usually has a mechanism for downloading the 'upstream'
version of an included project rather than having to put the binary into
CVS in the form of a patch, so it would help if there was some URL from
which the tarball could be downloaded. I've put it on my own website
temporarily or it could be put on the go-oo website, but it might be
simpler to just push it into the sourceforge file release system.

&gt;<i> Please note we consider the v1 API deprecated, so all current and future
</I>&gt;<i> work is focused on v2 which means that you are more likely to see SIL
</I>&gt;<i> OpenOffice.org upgraded to the v2 API before the v1 CVS and tarball sync
</I>&gt;<i> up.
</I>&gt;<i> Graphite v2 API is available via subversion at:
</I>&gt;<i> 	<A HREF="svn://scripts.sil.org/graphite/graphite/trunk">svn://scripts.sil.org/graphite/graphite/trunk</A>
</I>&gt;<i> however the latest version of v1 is available on sourceforge at:
</I>&gt;<i> 	<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/silgraphite">http://sourceforge.net/projects/silgraphite</A>
</I>&gt;<i> through the CVS repository there.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>OK great, thanks for the info

I've just done the neccessary work to integrate the patch into
ooo-build, and tested that it applies the patch etc fine on the old
ooo-build-2-0 branch.
Unfortunately it gives me an internal compiler error compiling the
silgraphite project, I've attached the log file.
This is in Fedora Core 4 with the following gcc:
gcc (GCC) 4.0.2 20051125 (Red Hat 4.0.2-8)

I've also attached the patch to ooo-build-2-0 and the slightly modified
form of your patch (paths adjusted, without tarball)
We'll need to test that it builds on HEAD / ooo-build-2-0-1 next before
adding it (rather add experimental stuff on HEAD)

Cheers
David
