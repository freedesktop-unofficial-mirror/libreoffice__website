<PRE>Hi!

I've updated the hacker tutorials for OOo and they are all now available
at: <A HREF="http://go-oo.org/wiki/index.php/Tutorials">http://go-oo.org/wiki/index.php/Tutorials</A>

Since the previous time, I had included a section on UNO
componentization and then putting everything together to locate the code
one is really interested in finding.

It would help if you could look them over for corrections, if you could
suggest more ideas or if you could point out shortfalls or anything else
really :-)

While this is really on my own and takes quite some time, I'll
definitely try to incorporate more things as we go ahead... Feel free to
improve the product by pointing out any shortcomings :-)

What I really think is:

&quot;Imagine you met a remarkable person who could look at the sun or stars
at any time of day or night and state the exact time and date: &quot;It's
April 23, 1401, 2:36AM and 12 seconds.&quot;  This person would be an amazing
time teller, and we'd probably revere that person for the ability to
tell time.  But wouldn't that person be even more amazing if, instead of
telling the time, he or she built a clock that could tell the time
forever, even after he or she was dead and gone.&quot;

 - James C. Collins and Jerry I. Porras,
   Chapter 2: &quot;Clock Building, Not Time Telling&quot;, Built to Last

That's what I was shooting for,

Happy Birthday, OpenOffice.org! :-)

Regards,
Raul

</PRE>
