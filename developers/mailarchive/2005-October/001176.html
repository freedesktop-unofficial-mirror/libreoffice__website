<PRE>Hello,

Is here the right place submitting patches to ooo-build? If I'm wrong,
I would appreciate if somebody could redirect me to the right place.
Thanks.

Reading the FAQ of ooo-build, ooo-build aims to simplify the hacking
work on OOo, or try to get in the patch that OOo does not have time
or interests in. Then, I would like to suggest a patch against OOo's
rendering on CJK characters.

For a long time, OOo cannot render CJK characters under Bold or Italic
style, including latest m130. But with the aid of embolden code of
freetype 2.10, KOffice, Abiword, etc, could display such style of
CJK characters perfectly. It is very disappointed that the most
widely used office application OOo does not have the corresponding
ability.

So, we've filed a issue here:
<A HREF="http://www.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=18285">http://www.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=18285</A>

But it seems that the corresponding maintainer of OOo hasn't
commented on this issue, even if the issue has won more than 300
votes.

As I'm not familiar with coding and hacking, I cannot evaluate
which patch would be better from a view of OOo hacker. So, I would
like get your professional opinion on these patches, or even get
it in ooo-build.

Regards.



</PRE>
