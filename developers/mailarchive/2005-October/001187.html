</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>	Nice :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>	Sure.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Firstly, it would be nice to autodetect building on Windows... patch 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>attached to issue a warning if you're using cygwin and don't say 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>--with-win32
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>	Right - it'd of course be nice to warn &amp; just turn on with_win32 or
</I>&gt;<i>whatever - either way; I committed your patch for that: thanks.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Thanks

&gt;&gt;<i>Secondly, on Windows you don't want KDE and Gnome support... unless I'm 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>mistaken. configure seems to assume you do unless you explicitly deny 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>it. so attached a patch to change this so win32 implies --disable-kde 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>and --disable-gtk
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>	Sure - as it happens they do no harm - and they also do some good: they
</I>&gt;<i>enable the building of the new icon sets / artwork which allow OO.o to
</I>&gt;<i>look (IMHO) rather nicer.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>OK fine, so on win32 they don't actually try build KDE libraries. that's 
good ;-)

&gt;&gt;<i>I was also wondering, it seems like the --with-ooo-builddir flag allows 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>you to run on top of an existing tree. Will this cause problems if 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>you've already been building on that tree or can you just migrate a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>standard build into ooo-build using this?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>	I would just move/copy/symlink the build into build/src680-m123 or
</I>&gt;<i>whatever - then it should apply the patches on top of that &amp; do a
</I>&gt;<i>relatively sane incremental build.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>OK cool I'll give it a go.

&gt;<i>	Great to have you hacking on this too though, it's somewhat under-used
</I>&gt;<i>as you can see :-)
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>This is where the synergy comes in, I need some way of maintaining 
patches and can't bear to do it without ooo-build :-)
Hopefully it'll help

Other things I've noticed:
on HEAD, cairo-1.0.0.tar.gz and glitz-0.4.3.tar.gz aren't getting 
downloaded, but the unpack expects them.
This seems to be because download.in has them in a non-Win32 section. So 
perhaps cairo isn't wanted on Windows...
In this case it would be good to have the default for cairo to be 
disabled on win32
As a result of this, I found that if unpack dies, then it re-unpacks the 
source tarball every time.
This is particularly slow when (like me) you're trying to build on a 
samba drive for lack of space on your Windows machine ;-)
(Incidentally patch also doesn't like renaming readonly files to .orig 
on a shared samba drive)
Still trying to get all the patches to apply, will report more tomorrow...

Cheers
David
