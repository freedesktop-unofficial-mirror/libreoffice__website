<PRE>Hi Funda

&gt;<i>Hello,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Is here the right place submitting patches to ooo-build? If I'm wrong,
</I>&gt;<i>I would appreciate if somebody could redirect me to the right place.
</I>&gt;<i>Thanks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Reading the FAQ of ooo-build, ooo-build aims to simplify the hacking
</I>&gt;<i>work on OOo, or try to get in the patch that OOo does not have time
</I>&gt;<i>or interests in. Then, I would like to suggest a patch against OOo's
</I>&gt;<i>rendering on CJK characters.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>For a long time, OOo cannot render CJK characters under Bold or Italic
</I>&gt;<i>style, including latest m130. But with the aid of embolden code of
</I>&gt;<i>freetype 2.10, KOffice, Abiword, etc, could display such style of
</I>&gt;<i>CJK characters perfectly. It is very disappointed that the most
</I>&gt;<i>widely used office application OOo does not have the corresponding
</I>&gt;<i>ability.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>So, we've filed a issue here:
</I>&gt;<i><A HREF="http://www.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=18285">http://www.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=18285</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>But it seems that the corresponding maintainer of OOo hasn't
</I>&gt;<i>commented on this issue, even if the issue has won more than 300
</I>&gt;<i>votes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>As I'm not familiar with coding and hacking, I cannot evaluate
</I>&gt;<i>which patch would be better from a view of OOo hacker. So, I would
</I>&gt;<i>like get your professional opinion on these patches, or even get
</I>&gt;<i>it in ooo-build.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Regards.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Its in hand ( or will be once the jca is submitted ) in anycase I indent 
to start preparing at least try and put this into ooo-build and in 
parallel prepare a cws. Thanks again for  volunteering to to the 
translations and for contacting Mr. FireFly, I hope also you will be 
able to help with any questions that may need to be directed to Mr FF, 
is that ok?
So I think you can take it that barring any stoppers ( I don't know if 
there will be any issues with freetype for example ) &amp; when the JCA 
stuff is done then this will at least make it into ooo-build. Of it will 
be better for everyone if it gets upstream.

regards,

Noel ( npower ;-) )
