It is a reasonable place to start.

</I>I assume you're refering to
    <A HREF="http://www.openoffice.org/nonav/issues/showattachment.cgi/30170/openoffice-1.9.m130-vcl-virtualstyles-20050919-01.patch">http://www.openoffice.org/nonav/issues/showattachment.cgi/30170/openoffice-1.9.m130-vcl-virtualstyles-20050919-01.patch</A>

&gt;<i> But it seems that the corresponding maintainer of OOo hasn't

</I>&gt;<i> votes.
</I>
The patch seems viable but there are some stylistic improvements
that could make it cleaner.
     - Remove the white space changes.
     - Rather than commenting 'added by mr firefly' it would be more
       helpful to reference the issuezilla number.
     - Some of the changes are not commented or do not comment at a
       high enough level.
	a) Why is 20pts a reasonable threshold to increase the
	font's gamma ?

	b) Why do this ?
	-    FT_Int nLoadFlags = FT_LOAD_NO_HINTING | FT_LOAD_NO_BITMAP;
	+    FT_Int nLoadFlags = FT_LOAD_DEFAULT | FT_LOAD_TARGET_LIGHT;

	c) Are those the only code pages that are interesting ?

None of these are huge hurdles but it would be nice to see some
discussion either in comments in the patch or in bugzilla with a
reference from the patch.
