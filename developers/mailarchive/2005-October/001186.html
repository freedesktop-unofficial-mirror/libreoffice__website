<PRE>Hi David,

	Nice :-)

&gt;<i> I had a few ideas to make this easier, and thought I would bounce them

</I>
	Sure.

&gt;<i> Firstly, it would be nice to autodetect building on Windows... patch

</I>&gt;<i> --with-win32
</I>
	Right - it'd of course be nice to warn &amp; just turn on with_win32 or
whatever - either way; I committed your patch for that: thanks.

&gt;<i> Secondly, on Windows you don't want KDE and Gnome support... unless I'm 
</I>&gt;<i> mistaken. configure seems to assume you do unless you explicitly deny 
</I>&gt;<i> it. so attached a patch to change this so win32 implies --disable-kde 
</I>&gt;<i> and --disable-gtk
</I>
	Sure - as it happens they do no harm - and they also do some good: they
enable the building of the new icon sets / artwork which allow OO.o to
look (IMHO) rather nicer.

&gt;<i> I was also wondering, it seems like the --with-ooo-builddir flag allows 
</I>&gt;<i> you to run on top of an existing tree. Will this cause problems if 
</I>&gt;<i> you've already been building on that tree or can you just migrate a 
</I>&gt;<i> standard build into ooo-build using this?
</I>
	I would just move/copy/symlink the build into build/src680-m123 or
whatever - then it should apply the patches on top of that &amp; do a
relatively sane incremental build.

	Great to have you hacking on this too though, it's somewhat under-used
as you can see :-)

	Thanks,

		Michael.
