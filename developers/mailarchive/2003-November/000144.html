	Ah - right.

&gt;<i> after adding these the icons are not rendered i.e if check is not

</I>
	The code is the authoritative place - we really need to annotate all
the items that are check items but the .src/.hrc is not in sync with the
code. This is a somewhat tedious task ( but luckily quite easily bounded
) - we just need to walk through clicking all the available menu items,
working out which are toggles and clobbering them.

	Great - thanks; for the big picture, this is so that we can up-stream
this change and Philipp can commit the patch that shrinks / re-lays out
the menus to make them far prettier up-stream [ the fix that we have
already ].

	Looking forward to having you full-time, and getting something serious
for you to get your teeth into :-)

	Regards,

		Michael.
