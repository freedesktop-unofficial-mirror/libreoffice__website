<PRE>Sorry, in the other approach section, I have wrongly specified
ImageButton c'to as Image c'tor. Please read that para as follows:
-------------------------
Therefore I tried to fix this in the ImageButton c'tor. (where Symbol
handling
is done). That seems to work (renders a proper image).
-------------------------
Sorry about this confusion.

Regards
-Anil

</I>Hi Michael,

Have tried the approach suggested earlier. 
------------------------------------------------------------
BitmapEx aBmp(ResId( SV_RESID_FOO_BAA,
              Resource::GetResManager());
    pDev-&gt;DrawBitmapEx( Point( foo_X, baa_Y ), aBmp );

    or something similar, to be added in DecorationView::DrawSymbol
------------------------------------------------------------

This gives me some junk image. On digging it further, I fould that the
size for the Bitmap that it gets from Resource Manager looks abnormal
(4912, 16) instead of (32, 32) or similar. I guess that before calling
Image/Bitmap Constructor, we need to call
ImplInitResData() and ImplLoadRes(), the way its hapenning in PushButton
c'tor. But these functions are available to children of Window classes.
DecorationView is not a child of Window. Can still try to do that but
have another point to discuss before that.

Tried this approach from multiple angles - Making a new Bitmap,
BitmapEx, Image, etc...   But another different approach worked that is
described later.

Another point - If this approach somehow works - BitmapEx, Bitmap or
Image would get constructed in DecoView::DrawImage or a related method.
I felt that there are 2 parts of drawing anything.

Part 1- Construct the image/symbol to be drawn in memory - All the
constructors (Image or Bitmap etc.) get called.

Part 2 - Only the drawing on the screen (Output Device) takes place.
This has to be as fast as possible. For Current DecoView - My
understanding is that this will be called on a Draw/Paint of dialog,
e.g. when a dialog is moved, or whenever a dialog is redrawn due to
shifting focus from another app to this one, or changing desktops while
dialog is displayed.

I felt that we should avoid calling Image or Bitmap c'tors in Part 2 as
it will be slowed down.

Therefore I tried to fix this in the Image c'tor. (where Symbol handling
is done). That seems to work (renders a proper image).

If we take this new approach we still need to fix at multiple places
(for PushButton, MenuItems, etc.) .

If you are ok with this approach, please let me know. In case you want
images to be rendered inside DecoView, I'll dig it up further. 

Btw, are there some general usage guidelines for VCL, something like API
help...? Basically I am looking for some doc that tells about the APIs
in VCL and the sequence in which they shd be called...

Regards
-Anil
