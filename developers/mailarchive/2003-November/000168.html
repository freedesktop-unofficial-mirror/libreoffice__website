I'd like to see that too, that's why I added it to the todo file, but
then my section of that file vanished ;-)

It should be only UI work. Add Optimal, Page Width etc. to the list.
Auto completion would be nice, too.

To zoom the view to Page Width etc, just create SvxZoomItems as in the
patch, but replace SVX_ZOOM_PERCENT with something else (can't remember
what, probably SVX_ZOOM_somethingelse).

The combobox will display the zoom level in percent even if you select
the named zoom levels. That's no problem, I think.

&gt;<i> &gt; other option is multi-page view, which i think is a good option to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; provide, apart from these i didnt get what is the issue, is there any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; issue no. which can be referred? or we have to create one.
</I>
The comment in the apply file points to the issue where I attached the patch.
No information about this part of the task though.

HTH,
	Martin
