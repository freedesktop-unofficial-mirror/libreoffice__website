	The fact you didn't commit my patch is not surprising; the fact that
you re-implemented it without any discussion with me and committed it,
without giving feedback was somewhat unfortunate I think. It makes me
wonder:

	 &quot;what else that I'm doing now is going to be re-written
	  and/or why should I bother doing anything&quot;.

	eg. if you are going to handle TTC collections, then I might as well
not bother, but back-port your code as/when it's ready. Of course - that
effectively isolates me from being able to help / contribute in that
area, and stops any ongoing maintenance interest I may have had in it -
which is a shame.

	Regards,

		Michael.
