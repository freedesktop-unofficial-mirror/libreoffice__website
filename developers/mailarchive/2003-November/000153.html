<PRE>Hi Anil,

	Right - this is very good overall, as always I'll comment on the patch
though initially:

&gt;<i> This patch does not have any of the ImageButton occurrences in any of
</I>&gt;<i> the .src files reverted back to Symbol.
</I>
	Right; that's just a matter of binning our patch to do that from apply:
pretty simple to do.

&gt;<i> Please let me know if this requires any changes or is ok to commit...
</I>
	It helps if you include the patch in-line so I can comment on it more
easily :-)

+  static const USHORT SYMBOL_TO_IMAGE_TABLE[];

	static const here, but missing a 'static' in the actual declaration -
perhaps not a problem but good to have it.

	Ok - this is one way to do this;

	My feeling is a cleaner way is to use two ImageLists one for small and
one for large images; if you grok .src files you may see some places
where these are used eg. LXR for IID_SCENARIOS.

+++ source/control/button.cxx

	This all looks great.
 
+const USHORT Image::SYMBOL_TO_IMAGE_TABLE[] = 
+  {

	Expandable as this is - I think it'd be nicer to have 2 tables; one for
small / one for large - so we don't have to have these comments all over
:<i>-) [ over-commenting is a real problem ].
</I>
	Also, I think it'd be nice to calculate the size of the tables (and
aggressively shrink them to avoid lots of NULL lines) using sizeof ie.
this is bad news:

+  if (nSymbolId &gt; 37)
+    return NULL;

	if (nSybolId &gt;= sizeof (table) /  sizeof (table[0]))
		return NULL;

	which is more robust to changes.

	Otherwise the lookup logic looks nice - I like the solution, it's more
elegant than doing this in DecoView I think.

+Image S_IMG_ARROW_DOWN
+{
+      ImageBitmap = Bitmap { File = &quot;sc10151.bmp&quot; ; };
+      MaskColor = Color { Red = 0xFFFF ; Green = 0x0000 ; Blue = 0xFFFF
; };
+};

	A pair of ImageLists here would potentially be much shorter :-) also,
it'd be nice to use the names of the icons instead of the numeric
versions; eg. SID_OUTLINE_DOWN/LEFT/UP/RIGHT etc. so it's more readable.

	Anyhow - does that all make sense ? sorry if it's somewhat unusual to
get public code critique this way, it does cut both ways :-) This was a
great effort for a first foray anyway so ...

	Thanks,

		Michael.
