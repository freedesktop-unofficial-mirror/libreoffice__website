<PRE>Hi Amit,

	I'm talking about the zoom combo in eg. writer; it sits beside the
Gallery button, and the available options that I see are:
25,50,75,100,150,200% - I'd like to see Optimal, Page Width, Entire Page
as per the bottom right-click zoom popup - I think that's a moderately
difficult task; the current code is implemented with
patches/OOO_1_1/zoom-combobox.diff - Martin did the work originally,
perhaps he can give you some pointers.

&gt;<i> other option is multi-page view, which i think is a good option to

</I>&gt;<i> issue no. which can be referred? or we have to create one.
</I>
	There is no issue number for the vast majority of problems, simply
because life is painful enough without adding extra work :-)

&gt;<i> What about the patch i sent for issue 49919 ?
</I>
	I'll have a dig.

&gt;<i> The ldap/evo task is still long way to go.
</I>
	Sure; it's a longer-term task :-) it'd be good if you could start a
document in openoffice/doc sketching points of reference, API points of
interest and an overview of what you're learning, with questions for
further study - so I can see what you're thinking :-)

	Thanks,

		Michael.
