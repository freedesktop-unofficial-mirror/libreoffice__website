<PRE>Hi Carlo,

	Ok - we need to debug this - since the above patch is a horrific hack (
as you can see :-). Can you tell me:

	a) what environment you're running under
		+ if Gnome - there should be a DPI setting in the font 
		  preferences that should be consistent across the 
		  desktop
		+ is your font size synched with the desktop font size?
	b) What xrdb -query | grep Xft says for you
	c) What xdpyinfo claims your DPI setting is (quite prolly this 
	   is wrong &amp; needs tweaking).

	Here (with Gnome) it integrates ~perfectly with my desktop syncing font
size, if it doesn't for you we need to investigate it very carefully.

&gt;<i> * The pdf export button in the toolbar does the export with the screen
</I>&gt;<i> resolution for images by default. Can I suggest to set it to &quot;press&quot;? It
</I>&gt;<i> seems more logical; eventually, do anybody know where the default is set?
</I>
	Where is the option to set that ? I had a dig in the code to locate it
(PDFWriter constructor parameter -&gt; PDFExport::Export's rFilterData
'CompressMode' property) it looks like it ends up loaded from
Office.Common/Filter/PDF/Export (
officecfg/registry/schema/org/openoffice/Office/Common.xcs - where
indeed it defaults to '1' - which is 'Print' mode. cf.
filter/source/pdf/impdialog.cxx &amp; pdfexport.cxx to verify.

	Print seems a reasonable default to me - are you sure it defaults to
'Screen' - or is that just what you used last ?

&gt;<i> * Also: what is the license for the icons created by Ximian? We would like
</I>&gt;<i> to distribute our build of OOo with your icons; of course giving due
</I>&gt;<i> credit and the url to get patches and files.
</I>
	The license is LGPL / SISSL assigned under the JCA, copyright is Ximian
of course :-) attributions gratefully received.

	If you have your own 'distribution' and want to sub-set our patches;
it's pretty easy to do; see patches/OOO_1_1_0/apply to see how Debian,
Ximian and 3 versions of RH play together.

	Finally I guess - if you're going to work with OO.o - it's best to sign
the JCA up-front see <A HREF="http://www.openoffice.org/contributing.html">http://www.openoffice.org/contributing.html</A>

	Best Regards,

		Michael.
