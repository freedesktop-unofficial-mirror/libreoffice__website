<PRE>Hello, everybody.

Could somebody tell me how to repeat OO build with ooo-build in case i
have already build OO and after that i added unzipped localized
helpcontent into $SRC_ROOT/solver/645/wntmsci8.pro/pck
Just running 'make' in the top of ooo-build begins to run and stops with
saying - nothing to do. I tried to delete compiled setup from instsetoo
and ran'make' again - result is the same - nothing to do. I would like
to have that repeated build, for example,  when i want to add new
dictionaries to OO after i have build one.
Is it possible to make repeated build with ooo-build?
Thanks in advance, any help is very appreciated.

P.S. ooo-build1.3.1, cygwin.
Just for note:
I still have problems to build under cygwin with ooo-build1.3.2 - some
weird errors with STLport, but didn't yet have time to figure it out(i
have error complaining about missing STLport, but if i install it - i
begin to get new errors concerned with that STLport).

Best regards,
Ruslan
