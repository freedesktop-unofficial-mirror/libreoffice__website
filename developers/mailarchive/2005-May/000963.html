<PRE>Hi,

I recently built ooo-build-m100 (with -system-m100 and -core-m100) but 
it fails to launch due to a segfault.  I have attached the entire 
backtrace for your review if you need it.

I am using Linspire 5.0 (which is what we are attempting to deploy on) 
which is based on a snapshot of Debian SID from about 3 or 4 months 
ago.  We are compiling with both KDE and GNOME support, if that has 
anything to do with it, but are only interested in the native KDE 
widgets and filepicker.

gcc is at 3.3.5.  I'll be happy to give any more information as needed.

Thanks in advance for your time.

-Brian

P.S.  I apologize if this is sent twice.
