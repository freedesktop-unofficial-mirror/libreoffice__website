<PRE>Hi,

	Quite sometime since my last status report. I've been looking into the
VBA interoperability all these days. Lot of code reading, notes etc.
Got some initial interfaces defined and Michael's helped with an initial
implementation/stub and integrating it into the build system. He has the
process of adding new interfaces captured in hackers guide.

Interfaces for WorkBook, WorkSheet and Range are defined and some dummy
implementation available for these.

I feel the progress is bit slow there, esp with lots of queries and
trying to figure out the answers for those thorough code reading etc.

Now, with these interfaces defined, next thing is to try to represent
the relation ship between WorkBook, WorkSheet and Range in .idl, as it
turns out the WorkSheet can be referred independently in which case it
refers to ActiveSheet or in the context of WorkBook or WorkSheets.
Similar is the case with Range to WorkSheet.

regards,
-Nicel.

</PRE>
