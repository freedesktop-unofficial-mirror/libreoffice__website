<PRE>Hi Robert,

	Patch looks nice - I guess the original bug is pretty silly - and yes,
I'd love to have this in ooo-build.

	2 questions:

	a) Have you signed &amp; posted a JCA ?

	b) could you change a couple of things for me :-)

		* We now use '.Copy(2)' a lot - can we have a 
		'getExtension' method in iodlgimp.hxx that does
		the Copy(2) to make that more explicit &amp; expandible
	
		* should this:

+				if ( rFile.Copy( p1 - p0 + 1) == 
					rLastFilterExt )

		be a case insensitive match ? EqualsIgnoreCaseAscii or 
		somesuch ?

	Apart from that it looks great :-) will commit as/when you confirm
JCA-ness.

	What else are you interested in hacking on ? and/or be great to see you
on irc.freenode.net #OpenOffice.org (ping michael_ :-)

	Thanks,

		Michael.
