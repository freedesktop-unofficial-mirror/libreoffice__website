<PRE>Hi!

 - Have been looking into integrating the OpenOffice settings with the
desktop settings and played around with the new GconfBackend in
shell/source/backends/gconfbe/ to retrieve the desktop settings using
that. Once that is done, the settings have to be propagated back into
OOo, so that the same settings are applied everywhere.

 - Putting everything together is the patch attached that needs to be
sent upstream for review.

 - Backported a fix in save as documents that fixed two major bugs.

 - Looked into the GNOME mini-commander for a change, poking at it to
get it to launch an email composer window when an email address is typed
in, and found/filed some problems there while getting that done.

 - In between, biked home ( motorcycle - 550 km ) with a friend over a
weekend through areas with temperatures averaging 40 degrees centigrade
just for the heck of it :-)

Regards,
Raul
