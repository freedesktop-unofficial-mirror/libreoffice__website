<PRE>Hi,
I've had a couple of testers give 2.0.2 a hard test today -- overall it went 
pretty well, but they did find a couple of problems (some are probably gcj 
related, some others might be local stuff).

1. The &quot;Wizards&quot; stuff in oowriter's file menu doesn't work (gcj?)
2. The package splits are a bit odd in some cases. Shouldn't the
   dictionaries go to the language packs instead of core?
3. The included media player doesn't work. Picking a sound from the gallery
   does nothing, opening it manually and trying to open any file results in
   &quot;The format of the selected file is not supported.&quot;
4. I can't reproduce this one myself, but one tester (who generally isn't
   a crackpot) reported the Gallery feature doesn't include any OpenClipart
   stuff, even though it was built with OpenClipart enabled.
   Strangely enough, deleting gengal.rdb fixed it for him?!
   The same user mentioned it would be nice to add the system icons
   (KDE/Gnome/...) to the Gallery -- sounds like a good idea to me too.
5. On a default install, Evolution is listed as a standard data source
   (even though it's not installed), but KDE AddressBook isn't.
   (While at it, neither are Mozilla and Thunderbird - may make sense to
   add those too).
   I'm not very familiar with the way OOO's database access works;
   does the attached fix (for the KDE AddressBook part) look right? If so,
   what's the best way to add it, given it has to add a binary file (kab.odb)?
6. ooimpress crashes with signal 11 when exiting. Not critical because the
   user wanted to exit anyway, but not very nice either.

Has anyone run into any of those before w/ a quick fix, or should I just throw 
them at issuezilla?


Other than these points, the feedback on this release has been overwhelmingly 
positive -- great work everyone.

Regards,
bero
