&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> I've had a couple of testers give 2.0.2 a hard test today -- overall it went 
</I>&gt;<i> pretty well, but they did find a couple of problems (some are probably gcj 
</I>&gt;<i> related, some others might be local stuff).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. The &quot;Wizards&quot; stuff in oowriter's file menu doesn't work (gcj?)
</I>
Works for me with jdk 1.4.2_09. BTW, what is the procedure that
OOo does when seeking for Java in menu Tools/Options/Java? Because I've
seen that if OOo 2.0.2 i586/32bit is installed under a
x86-64 system where it's installed both java32 (e.g. the sun
jre) and java64 bits (e.g. the blackdown jre), it waits a lot
of time before recognizing a valid java.

&gt;<i> 2. The package splits are a bit odd in some cases. Shouldn't the
</I>&gt;<i>    dictionaries go to the language packs instead of core?
</I>
IMHO this is a problem if doing that because one might still
want to hyphen or use dictionary for a language which is not installed.
For instance one might have installed the italian language pack
but wants to hyphenate or check dictionary of a french document in french.

Currently the dictionaries list is listed
&lt;oooinst&gt;/share/dict/ooo/dictionary.lst, and this file should be
upgraded for every dictionary|hyphenation pattern|thesaurus
added, so one have to play for instance with %post scripts or %triggers in case of dictionaries
into language pack files.

IMHO this should be changed at OOo source level, i.e. the dictionaries|hyphenation|etc.
should be taken either from &lt;oooinst&gt;/share/dict/ooo/dictionary.lst PLUS all the contents
of the files listed in &lt;oooinst&gt;/share/dict/ooo/dictionary.lst.d/*. This would be a lot
easier for point of view of adding and removing dictionary packages.

&gt;<i> 3. The included media player doesn't work. Picking a sound from the gallery
</I>&gt;<i>    does nothing, opening it manually and trying to open any file results in
</I>&gt;<i>    &quot;The format of the selected file is not supported.&quot;
</I>
I didn't knew there was an internal media player. How to activate it?

&gt;<i> 4. I can't reproduce this one myself, but one tester (who generally isn't
</I>&gt;<i>    a crackpot) reported the Gallery feature doesn't include any OpenClipart
</I>&gt;<i>    stuff, even though it was built with OpenClipart enabled.
</I>&gt;<i>    Strangely enough, deleting gengal.rdb fixed it for him?!
</I>&gt;<i>    The same user mentioned it would be nice to add the system icons
</I>&gt;<i>    (KDE/Gnome/...) to the Gallery -- sounds like a good idea to me too.
</I>
I see the openclipart gallery available to my installation.

&gt;<i> 5. On a default install, Evolution is listed as a standard data source
</I>&gt;<i>    (even though it's not installed), but KDE AddressBook isn't.
</I>&gt;<i>    (While at it, neither are Mozilla and Thunderbird - may make sense to
</I>&gt;<i>    add those too).
</I>&gt;<i>    I'm not very familiar with the way OOO's database access works;
</I>&gt;<i>    does the attached fix (for the KDE AddressBook part) look right? If so,
</I>&gt;<i>    what's the best way to add it, given it has to add a binary file (kab.odb)?
</I>
There is still one bug. If you go into menu:
Tools/Option/Internet/eMail and you click on the requester button (at
least under KDE), OOo crashes with error:

terminate called after throwing an instance of 
'com::sun::star::ucb::InteractiveNetworkGeneralException'

Bye
