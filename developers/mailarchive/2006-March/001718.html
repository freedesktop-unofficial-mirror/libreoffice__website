in X11. In other words I was referring to lists all the fonts that OOo might see 
(where it get from the font path, I mean all the fonts outside the
path &lt;oooinst&gt;/share/fonts/truetype,
and those which are &quot;discarded&quot; because are not good for it.
In particular I've seen that I've to look at the
$HOME/.ooo-2.0/user/psprint/pspfontcache as the system-wide one
in &lt;oooinst&gt;/share/psprint/fontmetric/pspfontcache is fixed.

What I wonder is this. How the pspfontcache is generated? Where it takes
the list of fonts path from? Apparently it seemed from the X11 xfs font server
(through /etc/X11/fs/config, or through command /usr/sbin/chkfontpath),
but indeed if I look at the $HOME/.ooo-2.0/user/psprint/pspfontcache I obtain
it lists also fonts which are not in the X11 font path, nor in fontconfig
(/etc/fonts/fonts.conf). E.g., I see in $HOME/.ooo-2.0/user/psprint/pspfontcache
entries like:

FontCacheDirectory:1128446655:/usr/lib/jdk-1.5.0_06/jre/lib/fonts
File:LucidaBrightDemiBold.ttf
2;1
Lucida Bright
-1;LucidaBright-Demi;0;8;5;2;65535;950;213;163;0;1404;1163;1404;1163;0;2
...

where it takes the path /usr/lib/jdk-1.5.0_06/jre/lib/fonts from?
An in case of OOo running remotely through X11, where it get the list from?

Now consider this case: I would like to get the Helvetica font shown
in documents that I import, with full antialias. But I don't have installed 
Helvetica (nor Arial) either in Type1 or TrueType/OTF. The X11 font server 
contains an Helvetica font, but it's not in Type1 but rather in ugly bitmap 
(file is in PCF format), so OOo 2.0 (at least those built to ignore the bitmap 
fonts) don't use nor show it as available. But indeed there is
&quot;Nimbus Sans L&quot; which is the &quot;Helvetica&quot; clone, part of free URW fonts in Type1. 
In the past OOO 1.1.X to do this, I had just to provide a &quot;fake&quot; &quot;fonts.dir&quot; 
somewhere containing entries, like:

n019003l.pfb -URW-Helvetica-medium-r-normal--0-0-0-0-p-0-iso8859-1

and OOo would have considered the file n019003l.pfb (which is indeed
font /NimbusSanL-Regu) as a real /Helvetica Type1 font. Now this seems ignored,
and the real name NimbusSanL-Regu (of family &quot;Nimbus Sans L&quot;) is used.
Note that this is different than providing &quot;font replacement table&quot; (menu
Tools/Options/Fonts, as with replacement you get basically replacement fallback 
for documents that you &quot;import&quot;
and that contains fonts which are not available, not
for documents that you &quot;export&quot; to platform where such font (in this
case Helvetica) might be available. In other words if you don't see
&quot;Helvetica&quot; Type1 listed into menu Insert/Special Character and
thus I guess into file pspfontcache, you can't write any document
from scratch using this font, even whether when importing a document
written in Helvetica it might use already some replacement.
Is there a way to achieve this? Apparently seems one have to add manually
entries into system-wide &lt;oooinst&gt;/share/psprint/fontmetric/pspfontcache
like this:

FontCacheDirectory:1137059379:/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Type1
File:n019003l.pfb
1;1
Helvetica
-1;Helvetica;1;8;0;1;65535;1012;211;223;0;755;723;755;723;0;Helvetica.afm;Regular

but the format of this file is not totally clear to me, and also it
seems dinamically regenerated at every run.

Thanks.
Bye
Giuseppe
