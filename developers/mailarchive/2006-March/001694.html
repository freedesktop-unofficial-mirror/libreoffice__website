<PRE>Hi,

ooo-build-2.0.2 has been released. You can found it at 
<A HREF="http://go-ooo.org/packages/OOB680/ooo-build-2.0.2.tar.gz">http://go-ooo.org/packages/OOB680/ooo-build-2.0.2.tar.gz</A>

You can found also the new OOO_2_0_2 sources there. Note that they differ from 
the oob680-m5 sources. The only difference is the patch for the issue 
i#62068, though.

In fact, you get the same result if you use the old oob680-m5 sources with the 
oob680-m5 build tag.

I'll do more official announce tomorrow if the new test build succeeds.


Best Regards,
Petr

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note 2: I could release ooo-build-2.0.2.x more times, for example on
</I>&gt;<i> Friday, if a crytical bug is found in todays release...
