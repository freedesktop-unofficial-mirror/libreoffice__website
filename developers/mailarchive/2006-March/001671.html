This is a bit odd, any insights into why you're getting this:

&gt;<i> java.lang.ClassNotFoundException:
</I>&gt;<i> org.apache.xerces.dom.DOMXSImplementationSourceImpl
</I>
This has been part of Xerces for a rather long time, and if you didn't have 
Xerces you'd run into different trouble...
Maybe we just need to make sure Xerces is in the classpath? Does the bit that 
adds xercesImpl.jar to the classpath act up for you? Or is your Xerces older 
than DOMXSImplementationSourceImpl?

&gt;<i> If you need additional/different stuff, why don't you make a extra/a
</I>&gt;<i> modified patch for you?
</I>
This is what I'll do for now, but I'd of course prefer a solution that works 
for everyone for 2 reasons -- first of all, other patches 
(xt-precompile.diff) modify the same makefile.mk, so we'll have to split all 
of them for one, if we don't get this sorted out. Second, I want ooo-build to 
work on as many platforms as possible without having to add patches or copy 
around distro specific patches, and that can't work if the build process 
makes faulty assumptions. (Apparently both of us are making faulty 
assumptions that are mutually incompatible -- we need to find some way to fix 
this).

The patch without the -D bits is definitely broken because it assumes the 
default jaxp implementation to be Xerces (the code being executed doesn't 
work with other JAXP implementations -- see the various reports of 
NullPointerExceptions from HelpLinker, I'm not the only one getting them), 
but does nothing at all to indicate to jaxp.xml.parsers.* that it should be 
picking Xerces over whatever the default is.
