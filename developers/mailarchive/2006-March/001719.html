&gt;<i> Hi,

</I>&gt;<i> here a short overview over psprint's font discovery that i hope covers 
</I>&gt;<i> the open questions. Please feel free to contact me if you want to know 
</I>&gt;<i> more.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> psprint discovers fonts in this order:
</I>&gt;<i> - from fontconfig if available
</I>&gt;<i> - from &lt;office&gt;/share/fonts/truetype,
</I>&gt;<i>        &lt;office&gt;/share/fonts/type1,
</I>&gt;<i>        &lt;userinst&gt;/user/fonts
</I>&gt;<i>        the currently selected java runtime (jre)
</I>&gt;<i> - from the environment variable SAL_PRIVATE_FONTPATH (usually empty)
</I>&gt;<i> - from the X fontpath if fontconfig was NOT available (also on a remote 
</I>&gt;<i> connection since these paths are often the same within a network)
</I>&gt;<i> - from chkfontpath if the X font path is examined and server entries found
</I>&gt;<i> - from some standard X font directories if the X font path is examined
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> in the directories collected the fonts.alias files are opened and 
</I>&gt;<i> corresponding alias names are added to the discovered fonts.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The attributes of all discovered fonts are stored in pspfontcache as to 
</I>&gt;<i> not access every font on startup; a group of font cache entries gets 
</I>&gt;<i> invalidated if the modification time of the directory containing those 
</I>&gt;<i> entries has changed.
</I>
This means that it's not possible to provide an hand-tuned system-wide 
pspfontcache? As I've seen there it's possible to provide Type1 metric .afm
files as standalone (i.e. without the corresponding .pfb file), or metric .afm 
for different PFB/Type1 fonts.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> psprint's fontlist concerns only fonts for which we have access to the 
</I>&gt;<i> font files (so we can download them to PostScript or PDF or render them 
</I>&gt;<i> with freetype). In vcl the normal X fonts are added to this list, but of
</I>&gt;<i> course X fonts can only be displayed on the display. If there are two 
</I>&gt;<i> fonts with the same name and attributes, then the psprint font gets 
</I>&gt;<i> chosen since X fonts tend to be low quality (no antialiasing, often only 
</I>&gt;<i> certain sizes available).
</I>
In fact I think I build with a patch disabling thus bitmap/no AAsed fonts.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As for the question of document creation on systems where you do not 
</I>&gt;<i> have Helvetica: you can always create a document with Helvetica by 
</I>&gt;<i> entering &quot;Helvetica&quot; into the font combobox. The font stored in the 
</I>&gt;<i> document will be &quot;Helvetica&quot; then regardless what actually gets shown on 
</I>&gt;<i> the screen. Of course it is always helpful to have either a Helvetica 
</I>&gt;<i> font or a font aliased to Helvetica (either through fontconfig or 
</I>&gt;<i> fonts.alias, if you don't have fontconfig).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
The problem is that in fontconfig (I've both fontconfig and xfs/chkfontpath)
I've already entries/rules for getting Helvetica-&gt;Nimbus Sans L aliases
(or the same for Times-Roman-&gt;Nimbus Roman No9 L), but they seems ignored
by OOo2. What I wonder is also whether fonts.dir is now ignored?

The second problem is that if in the font box I type Helvetica
(or any other fontname, such as 'MyGenericFont'), as
soon as I switch to the composition window, the current font automatically
switches to the default font and not to Helvetica or what I've type in the
fontbox.

Furthermore if I provide the Helvetica in fonts.alias instead of fonts.dir
I think that it will confuse the xfs font server, as Helvetica
already exists in PCF/bitmap format.


IMHO we can have this cases:

- suppose I'm successfully in let OOo see the n019003l.pfb
as &quot;Helvetica&quot; (the n019003l.pfb has fontname /NimbusSanL-Regu)
but when printing there are two choice IMHO:

1) since Helvetica is part of the AdobeStandard 35 fonts, as well
as of the standard PDF 14 fonts, it's a &quot;resident&quot; font, so it
could also not be included in either the PostScript or PDF output.
Of course this won't apply if instead of Helvetica I've a
font called &quot;MyGenericFont&quot; which is mapped to n019003l.pfb.

2) since /Helvetica mapped to /NimbusSanL-Regu might
become a de-facto like any other OOo fonts, probably the
PS/PDF output might contain the NimbusSanL-Regu font (or
a subset of it).

Thanks.
Bye
Giuseppe.
