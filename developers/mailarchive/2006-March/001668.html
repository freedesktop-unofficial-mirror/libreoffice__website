<PRE>Hi Michael and Peter

&gt;<i>  Hi Jan,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	Did you mean to CC Peter / the list ?
</I>
He is not subscribed in this mailing list? OK, I will send him a copy to be sure.

&gt;<i> &gt; Well, I don't know what your experience with KDE is  - no offence 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; please! - but KDE enables running Gnome applets for a long time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ;-) OTOH KDE applets in Gnome suck badly; AFAIR a WM spec. violation on
</I>&gt;<i> that side.
</I>
Anyway, we are the lucky ones. GTK applets runs on KDE reasonably
well, the rest is not OOo business.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In my KDE systray are KDE as well as Gnome applets running
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; right now - Gaim and Gnome Network Monitor (it' better than KDE
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; default one, so I'm using it) 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	Sure.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What I want to say there is absolutely no need to do cross-desktop
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tweaking of any file. Just make a nice Gnome applet and don't disable
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it when KDE desktop is detected. Better not to detect running desktop 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; environment at all. They are all freedesktop.org compatible, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; aren't they? ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	So - the thing is; if you want to test having Qt and Gtk+ both talking
</I>&gt;<i> to X in the same process, and integrating nicely *And* take the
</I>&gt;<i> performance hit from having both of those in process - that's fine;  but
</I>&gt;<i> there are a ton of people out there with a rather frenzied antipathy to
</I>&gt;<i> any gtk+ on KDE and VV. &amp; I don't want to fight them :-)
</I>
Let's concentrate on GTK plugin. 
For GTK people: take it or leave it and use alternative external project.
Just not disable completely quickstarter option.


&gt;<i> It's easy to patch the comparison out; test it - if it works - go for
</I>&gt;<i> it. Of course - more code is really required - to initialize gtk+
</I>&gt;<i> correctly if it has not already been done [ for the right display etc. ]
</I>&gt;<i> - and that is why we just check if gtk+ is inited already; but ... that
</I>&gt;<i> code can be added: but it's work &amp; testing &amp; I don't have a KDE system
</I>&gt;<i> &amp; ... :-)
</I>
I will look at it.


&gt;<i> &gt; I suspect, that detection of running environment was &quot;enhanced&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Not sure; I didn't touch that code for 1.
</I>
Dates at patch files are quite new so someone did.
I will look at this.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Well I discovered that oowriter runs ooqstarter which runs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; soffice (shell script) which lanches soffice.bin soffice.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I can run soffice.bin stright away. So what is the point of this step?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Can I say ooqstarter to skip this step?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sure - ooqstart however helps you *a lot* on the 2nd start - that is
</I>&gt;<i> particularly nice wrt. responsiveness - it also gives you the splash
</I>&gt;<i> fast.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So my question is how to launch ooffice not to be completely 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; released form memory when the last window is closed.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Without this option any external quickstarter is useles.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Use the systray quickstarter ;-&gt;
</I>
Sorry I didn't get the point? I'm using systray quickstarter.

Anyway I also tried preloading &quot;manually&quot; using two consoles.
In one:
/usr/lib/OpenOffice.org.2/program/soffice.bin -nologo -nodefault
..to preload OOo
In the other: 
oowriter or oofice or ooqstart -writer or soffice.bin
The first lunch was well acclerated, I get times even under 1s ! Amazing!
But when I close Writer window, preloading instance was also shutted.
So with another Writer launch I got just 'usual' times because nothing 
was preloaded now.
Is this an intended behaving? 
Under such circumstances any external preloader couldn't work :( 

Anyway, I must congratulate to OOo developers team, overall statup times 
are quite good now.

1) preloaded OOo
$time -p /usr/lib/OpenOffice.org.2/program/ooqstart -writer
real 0.72 - COOL !! 

2) preloaded OOo
$time -p /usr/lib/OpenOffice.org.2/program/soffice.bin -writer -nologo
real 1.67

3) nothing preloaded, repeated ooqstart
real 4.83 - GOOD time, but repeated startup has no effect, startup times were the same, roughly around 4.6s, strange

4) nothing preloaded, repeated soffice.bin
time -p /usr/lib/OpenOffice.org.2/program/soffice.bin -writer -nologo
6.5s - 8s
time -p /usr/lib/OpenOffice.org.2/program/soffice.bin -nologo
4s - 5s
