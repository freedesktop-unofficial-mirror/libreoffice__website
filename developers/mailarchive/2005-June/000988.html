I'm afraid I haven't been able to see the problem in m100 and m104 so
far trying the gtk file-selector or the native one. I'll set off an m106
to see if I can reproduce it on that.

The file sfx2/source/doc/guisaveas.cxx has a while loop that sets off
the Save as... dialog. Bonsai does not show any major changes there. But
while that is an entry point, the whole interconnections in sfx2 are
what keeps it running fine:

sfx2/source/doc/guisaveas.cxx: 1244:

        while ( !bExit )
        {
            bUseFilterOptions = aModelData.OutputFileDialog( nStoreMode,
aFilterProps, bSetStandardName );
            if ( nStoreMode == SAVEAS_REQUESTED )
            {
                // in case of saving check filter for possible alien warning
                ::rtl::OUString aFilterName = aModelData.GetMediaDescr().getUnpackedValueOrDefault(
                                                                                ::rtl::OUString::createFromAscii( &quot;FilterName&quot; ),
                                                                                ::rtl::OUString() );
                sal_Int8 nStatusSave = aModelData.CheckFilter( aFilterName );
                if ( nStatusSave == STATUS_SAVEAS_STANDARDNAME )
                {
                    // switch to best filter
                    bSetStandardName = sal_True;
                }
                else if ( nStatusSave == STATUS_SAVE )
                {
                    // user confirmed alien filter or &quot;good&quot; filter is used
                    bExit = sal_True;
                }
            }
            else
                bExit = sal_True;
        }

I had worked on a problem earlier where the problem was that the
filepicker's getCurrentFilter() was returning a value/string that was
incorrect and in the inter-working somewhere, the condition to exit the
loop [aFilterName, and then CheckFilter()] was not being satisfied.

The other problem I had seen was where the Alien document format warning
was returning an error code that had not been handled in that file
initially, so the while loop was not quitting there as well, but both of
these problems were fixed earlier.

I'll try to look into it if I see it, but I am unable to see the problem
currently.

Regards,
Raul
