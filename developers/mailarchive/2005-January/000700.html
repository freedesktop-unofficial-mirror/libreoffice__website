<PRE>* The patch qpro-detect.diff wasn't applying in 1.1.3. Had to change the
order in which the lotus and quattro pro patches were applied.
The build is still going on.
* Generated sample documents for testing QPro work. There is one file
complex.wb2 already present in ooo-build/test/qpro/.
* Read the use cases sent by Nagashree and made a few changes to the
same.
Tomorrow would be generating a few more sample files with corresponding
documentation as to which is the feature is being tested. 

Regards
Shilpa
