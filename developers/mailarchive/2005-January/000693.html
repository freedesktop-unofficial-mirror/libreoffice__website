<PRE>Hi,

* more visibility stuff: cross verified svx after the changes reqd for
win build. Came across an issue; happened to be fixed with the latest;
so only a local fix was required.
But, an issue in packaging process blocked my smoke-test. redhat/suse
menus rpms were not getting built. Pavel helped me fix that. Just had to
export RPM with 'rpmbuild'; and this seems to be fixed with the latest.

Again, my smoke-test seems to be failing giving an error dialog 'The
application cannot be started. An internal error occured'

Since both solaris and windows builds have passed, suspect something is
going wrong in my setup. Anyway, waiting for mhu's verification report.

* visibility03: Completed sot; onto unotools.

thanks,
-Nicel.
