&gt;<i> Hi,

</I>&gt;<i> 	To solve this problem at this time, we will lost some control when the sheet is invisible. or change the OOo's behavior like MSO. 
</I>So, what you are saying is that we will loose the ability to set some
attributes on a control that 'lives' on a sheet that is not curently
selected.
&gt;<i> And I think MSO's behavior is more suitable for Basic process. Noel, any suggestion?
</I>So, it would appear that OO implementation is not helper for us then and
seems to be tied too tightly to the drawing layer. You should imo be
able to modify the state of the control e.g. its visibilty attribute
( and surely that state is stored somewhere ) so that when the sheet
does become the active sheet the control 'knows' is should be visible or
have focus or whatever.  My suggestion is that we forget about this for
the moment, rewriting how the controls act/interact with the drawing
layer is something I would prefer to avoid ;-) 
My main issue was the implementation was unusable right now because of a
side affect of the above,
&gt;<i> 	So ,I will remove the m_xWindowPeer variable from the ScVbaControl. And create a new help function for focus, visible etc..
</I>yes, I would create a helper function to return the XWindow peer for the
Control to be used by set/getVisble etc. and if someone tries to access
that functionality on a control that on a non-visible sheet then this
will throw. That should be sufficient thanks :-)
&gt;<i> 	Should we CC the mail to or discuss the TAB behavior <A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/openoffice">dev at openoffice.org</A> ? 
</I>As suggested I will cc this to <A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/openoffice">openoffice at lists.ximian.com</A> 
perhaps a query to <A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/openoffice">dev at openoffice.org</A> might yield some interesting
information
