<PRE>Hi Caolan,

	We're suffering some nasty issues with bullet import / export.

	It seems on export wrtw8num.cxx (SubstituteBullet) uses
StarSymbolToMSMultiFont to switch font / character (and it's own mapping
stuff).

	However - on re-import we are having issues - such that we end up with
a 0xb7 character for the stock bullet in font &quot;symbol&quot;, which is
somewhat broken :-) The import code in ww8par3.cxx (AdjustLVL) seems
bereft of equivalent cleverness.

	By adding manglings to VCL's fontcvt.cxx the problem can be hidden; [
in ImplRecodeString ], however this seems somewhat inelegant to me (if
not plain wrong). That code (it appears) is only used by the internal
OutputDevice::Layout code at render-time.

	So - I guess my question is: what is the big-picture strategy for the
symbol font / the piece-wise approach that MS adopts ? do we keep the
font as a non-existent &quot;symbol&quot; internally and then try to map that to
real characters at render time ? or is there something better whereby we
can map to open/star symbol on import (much like the converse on export)
?

	Also; I guess reading it introduced me to the RTL_TEXTENCODING_SYMBOL
charset - how does that tie in ?

	The problem (apparently) doesn't manifest itself with the stock OO.o -
but I havn't verified that. Since we don't really patch this ourselves,
I guess that is down to some font-subsetting / listing issue - we have a
rather reduced set of (only truetype) fonts.

	Advice / input / code pointers much appreciated,

	Thanks,

		Michael.
