<PRE>&gt;<i> It seems that in standard OOo, there's a font called &quot;Standard Symbols&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> which is mapped to correspond to a private unicode codespace (F0xx). I
</I>&gt;<i> _think_ what's going on is that standard OpenOffice.org is mapping the
</I>&gt;<i> character C2B7 (given the font &quot;Symbols&quot;) to this font w/ the unicode
</I>&gt;<i> number F0B7. Hence perfect bullets every time. Is this correct?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If so, my next question would be: where does this font come from? I
</I>&gt;<i> can't find it anywhere in the OpenOffice.org distribution (I see the
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSymbols font, but that seems to be used for something else). There's
</I>&gt;<i> a Type1 font on my system in /usr/share/fonts/default/Type1 called &quot;URW
</I>&gt;<i> Standard Symbols&quot;, which seems to be exactly identical, except for the
</I>&gt;<i> fact that it has different unicode mappings.
</I>
There isn't &quot;Standard Symbols&quot; in OOo. The only font coming with it
is &quot;OpenSymbol&quot; and is a TrueType font.

Note that another Symbol font is called &quot;Symbol&quot; (note &quot;Symbol&quot; and not &quot;Symbols&quot;)
and is available from from Windows (symbol.ttf, in true type) or from Adobe Acrobat
Reader (Symbol or sy_____.pfb|pfa in Type1). And generally should be added
manually to OOo.

The fonts you are talking about is probably the font called
&quot;Standard Symbols L&quot; (this is the family name) and comes from
the URW fonts which are generally provided with ghostscript and
is also available to X11 and thus to OOo. Such font isn't
UNICODE encoded itself, and is a Type1 fonts. It has glyphs reencoded
in a vector with position from 0 to 255, so probably the Unicode re-encoding
is performed interally by OOo according to glyph names.

Speaking of such &quot;Standard Symbols L&quot; font, I also found a problem in using such font
when printing, see the bug issue #20595 on OOo IssueZilla.

Note also that using Symbol font is different than using &quot;Standard Symbols L&quot;
font, as unless one add a specific &quot;Symbol -&gt; Standard Symbols L&quot; font replacement
(and I don't see it), the Symbol font is considered
&quot;resident&quot; when printing, as it's part of the Adobe Standard 35 PostScript font set,
while for any other font, it's downloaded/dumped in the PostScript file itself.

Bye.
Giuseppe.
