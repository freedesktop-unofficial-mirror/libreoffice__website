<PRE>Hi Suka,

	Uh ? why do you want to do that ? ultimately, if you use ooo-build and
package-ooo (ie. make / make install ) you will get all the languages
built and installed;

&gt;<i> I couldn't find any informations on how it is supposed, sorry if
</I>&gt;<i> overlooked something, maybe you can point me to the relevant bits. I
</I>&gt;<i> just know that it doesn't work anymore with passing --with-lang=GER (for
</I>&gt;<i> example) to configure ;-)
</I>
	Well - by default we build all the lang-packs, however we don't build
installable binaries for all of them; since we have a far, far more
efficient / clever install process in package-ooo based on Debian's
work; thus we save having 20 copies of the full packed OO.o which speeds
up builds and saves lots of disk space.

	So - if you just run package-lang in bin/ you should get the right
effect. If you really want to get a single-language package build you
can do that by doing: export BUILD_MINMAL=&quot;33&quot; - or whatever the number
is for your language [ or dmake pack_33 in instsetoo/util ] - but I can
assure you you almost certainly don't want to do that :-)

&gt;<i> The reason I am asking is that I am providing an (atm non-official)
</I>&gt;<i> ebuild for Gentoo of openoffice-ximian 1.1 and want to get the
</I>&gt;<i> localization stuff done (one of the last missing bits)
</I>
	Great - well; I would strongly encourage you to use a stock -
ooo-build; and do a ./configure, make, make install on it. I'm most
interested in making ooo-build fit your setup / getting you a
patch-sub-set in the same way as Debian; clearly sharing as much
infrastructure as possible helps. Incidentally - have you signed the
JCA?

&gt;<i> btw: Great work you are doing with the patches!!!
</I>
	Thanks; it'd be great to have you working on helping us improve
ooo-build so it does the right thing on gentoo 'out of the box' :-)

	Regards,

		Michael.
