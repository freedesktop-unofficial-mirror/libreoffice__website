<PRE>Hi Will,

	So - the no. 1 tool for font work is pfaedit; I'd grab that and have a
poke inside the relevant fonts; particularly opens___.ttf.

	Of course (it seems to me) the free font setup gets less testing than
the StarSymbol version of OO.o.

&gt;<i> _think_ what's going on is that standard OpenOffice.org is mapping the
</I>&gt;<i> character C2B7 (given the font &quot;Symbols&quot;) to this font w/ the unicode
</I>&gt;<i> number F0B7. Hence perfect bullets every time. Is this correct?
</I>
	Have a dig at vcl/source/gdi/fontcvt.cxx - possibly therein lies the
answer to the question in the form of a broken mapping somewhere; my
feeling is that last time I looked at this the starsymbol mapping was
shared with opensymbol despite these two fonts being substantially
differently layed out (in error).

	Anyhow; fontcvt is the place to dig, for sure.

	HTH,

		Micahel.
