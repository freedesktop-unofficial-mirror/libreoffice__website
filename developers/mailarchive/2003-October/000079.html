<PRE>Hi,

I'm running into some issues with bulleted lists and Ximian OOo 1.1
(see: <A HREF="http://bugzilla.ximian.com/show_bug.cgi?id=49212">http://bugzilla.ximian.com/show_bug.cgi?id=49212</A>). Basically, the
problem is that Ximian OOo 1.1 won't properly re-import the bullets from
an exported MSWord 97 document (since this file format is the default,
this is a big problem). I'm narrowing down the problem, but I'd
appreciate some insight as to how standard OpenOffice.org behaves in
this case so I can create a fix.

It seems that in standard OOo, there's a font called &quot;Standard Symbols&quot;,
which is mapped to correspond to a private unicode codespace (F0xx). I
_think_ what's going on is that standard OpenOffice.org is mapping the
character C2B7 (given the font &quot;Symbols&quot;) to this font w/ the unicode
number F0B7. Hence perfect bullets every time. Is this correct?

If so, my next question would be: where does this font come from? I
can't find it anywhere in the OpenOffice.org distribution (I see the
OpenSymbols font, but that seems to be used for something else). There's
a Type1 font on my system in /usr/share/fonts/default/Type1 called &quot;URW
Standard Symbols&quot;, which seems to be exactly identical, except for the
fact that it has different unicode mappings.

Thanks in advance,
--
