Until now we used our own build system, but I agree with you that it
would be best to use yours as a unified version for all (this should
also make the gentoo ebuild a lot less complex ;-) ). So I will look
into that, when I find enough time (&quot;real life&quot; work keeps me quite
occupied atm :-( ), but the intent is there.

About the JCA: As my hacking skills are quite non-existant, are there
any reasons for me to sign one, I don't think I could provide more than
just testing and adjusting of the build system.

&gt;<i> 	Thanks; it'd be great to have you working on helping us improve

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Let's try so :-)

P.S.: Sorry for answering that late...
