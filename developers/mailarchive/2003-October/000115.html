<PRE>Hi there,

	After doing some interesting debugging of the symbol mapping code in
VCL, it seems that in the final evaluation the reason saving /
re-loading a file in word format fails to give correctly rendered
bullets (indeed many symbols are completely lost) is that:

	vcl/source/gdi/fontcvt.cxx's aAdobeSymbolTab is mapping a load of the
symbols (particularly bullets) into the 0xe1XX range - and a cursory
glance in pfaedit at extras/source/truetype/symbol/opens___.ttf shows
that these are simply missing in both HEAD and OpenOffice_1_1 branches.

	Of course - with the corresponding StarSymbol font installed the
problem disappears; this is particularly annoying, since it seems the
characters at offset 0xe1XX are in fact simply a re-arranged version of
a whole set of characters that already exist in both OpenSymbol and
StarSymbol at different offsets.

Q1:	Is there any reason for this duplication in the font? are there
perhaps different metrics or somesuch ? or is this just to make the
mapping table slightly easier to understand ?

Q2:	What is the plan / strategy here ? I can spend hours cutting and
pasting symbols around inside opens___.ttf to match a similar layout in
the latest starsymbol font - but is this a fruitful use of my time ?
should we instead adjust the mapping table, eg. using OpenS#2663 instead
of StarS#e11e (eg.) or is there some more clever strategy.

	Since this is a particularly nasty show-stopper bug for Ximian shipping
our 1.1.0 based packages, I'm really interested in doing something about
this fast - early advice would presumably save me/you a lot of time
later.

	OTOH - it's possible that I've badly misunderstood almost everything;
fontcvt.cxx (ImplRecodeString) method is called with
pConversion-&gt;mpCvtTab == &amp;aAdobeSymbolTab for this case where
ImplGetRecodeData was called with 'symbol', 'opensymbol' for
rOrgFontName, rMapFontName.

	Many thanks,

		Michael.
