<PRE>Hi Caolan,

	Firstly, thanks so much for the great write-up, extremely helpful as I
try and untangle what we've done wrong somehow.

	Sure - it makes sense to convert immediately before rendering; knowing
that is the strategy helps me understand the code a lot better. It
interests me that while the export process can switch-font &amp; character,
it seems the render RecodeString can only switch character - so there
must be some font munging stuff I've not found yet.

</I>
	Well ;-) it made things different, I now get nice boxes instead of
characters; and indeed we're doing some re-coding action: my churning
debug says fontcvt's RecodeString does: recode 0xf0b7 to 0xe12c - which
is fun I suppose :-) unfortunately, that is a non-existent character in
the font [ and makes little sense to me ]. Anyhow - investigations
continue.

&gt;<i> The charset for a font describes the source encoding of nonunicode text

</I>&gt;<i> seeing as this charset is totally unregulated and nonstandard between

</I>
	:-) right; I see stuff in sal/ to munge this sort of thing, must have a
read.

&gt;<i> So if you write a native .sxw writer document with OOo under windows and

</I>
	Right :-) so - nauseatingly word does a great job of hunting bullets
for various combinations of export from OO.o in .doc format, so
everything we export loads fine in word, but not back to OO.o ;-) There
were a couple of initial queries I had though in psudo patch form:

+const sal_Unicode cBulletChar	= 0x25cf;	// Charakter fuer Aufzaehlungen

	Why do we use a rather small bullet char for our default bullet in OO.o
? it seems Word 97 by default uses a rather larger version; is there
some highly subtle / fragility around here ? an LXR for 0x2022 gets a
number of scattered hits which is interesting.

	In a similar vein is this code what is intended:

+        nEntries = 0; /* ? */
 
     for (i = 0; i &lt; nEntries; ++i)
     {

	Is it a feature that the 1st element of the 'aggressive' table is used
even if bPerfectOnly is selected ? also, since aAgressiveTable contains
a load of integer / numeric indicees can we call it 'anAgressiveTable'
;-&gt;

	Thanks again,

		Michael.
