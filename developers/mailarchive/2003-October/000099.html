	Quite; of course spare CPU time is not such a problem - most people
are  not belting their CPU overnight; it's really just a disk-space
issue.

	Of course, if you only have ~2GB of spare space, you could help by
re-hashing some of the 'deliver' scripts to use hard-linking instead of
copying ;-) [ eg. ], which would be a help to others;

	Anyhow - this question really belongs on the mailing list that was
linked in the announcement itself; where Dan lurks who can help you with
Fedora OO.o questions too.

	HTH,

		Michael.
