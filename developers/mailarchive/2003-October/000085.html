I checked this last Friday. Both of them have a bullet symbol in them,
but I'm practically certain the font we're missing is a remapped
&quot;Standard Symbols&quot;. Open up a copy of non-Ximianized OOo 1.1: go to
insert character, and check out the Standard Symbols font: you'll see
that it's exactly the same as URW Standard Symbols except that the
unicode mappings are different (e.g.: F0B7 instead of B7). In Ximian
OOo, there is _no_ such mapping (e.g.: we have B7 where we should have
F0B7)

Note, however, that the unicode points for the bullet in opens___.ttf
are identical between Ximian OOo and stock OpenOffice.org (there do seem
to be some minor differences elsewhere, which is worrying, but probably
isn't the source of this particular problem).

&gt;<i> 	Of course (it seems to me) the free font setup gets less testing than

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; _think_ what's going on is that standard OpenOffice.org is mapping the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; character C2B7 (given the font &quot;Symbols&quot;) to this font w/ the unicode
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; number F0B7. Hence perfect bullets every time. Is this correct?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	Have a dig at vcl/source/gdi/fontcvt.cxx - possibly therein lies the

</I>&gt;<i> feeling is that last time I looked at this the starsymbol mapping was
</I>&gt;<i> shared with opensymbol despite these two fonts being substantially

</I>
I had a look at this code last week, nothing immediately popped out at
me (I did notice the xx -&gt; F0xx stuff, though). I guess it doesn't hurt
to check again, but I do feel rather lost. Surely there must be someone
on dev@ who would know exactly what's going on? 

Thanks,
