    mm&gt; Hi Vladimir,

    &gt;&gt; My menu fonts only in OpenOffice 1.0.3-Ximian are tiny, and no amount of
    &gt;&gt; fooling around with the Personal Settings Font applet or the
    &gt;&gt; Administrator Display applet changes them permanently. (Other
    &gt;&gt; Ximian applications, including Evolution do not exhibit this behavior.)
    mm&gt; 
    mm&gt;         It'd be great if you could see if the problem persists in the 1.1.0
    mm&gt; snapshots available in red-carpet in the 'ooo-snapshot' channel for
    mm&gt; RH9/SuSE8.2.

Unfortunately the problem persists, although not as severely. Originally
I did a clean install of RH9, upgraded everything via up2date and then
applied XD2, the Font Settings applet seems to be stuck on 96dpi (which
then becomes the value that Xft sees via xrdb). 

If I change the Font Settings dpi to 75 and adjust my font sizes, then
X, Xft and the Font Settings applet are all in alignment (along with
Mars, Jupiter and several lesser asteroids).

Now the font size of OO (1.0.3 or 1.1unstable) does not match that of
the application font I specify in Font Settings. Fortunately the size is
no longer teeny, just small (one size smaller?) so I can live with it.

No other application (so far) seems to have this problem, but when I run
a Java/Swing application and change the look &amp; feel from Java to GTK+, I
get the same small fonts. I have not tried other Java/Swing applications.

    &gt;&gt; How do I permanently change the size of menu fonts in OpenOffice
    &gt;&gt; applications? I didn't find anything by googling around that worked.
    mm&gt; 
    mm&gt;         It should use the Gnome application font size, as got from
    mm&gt; getstyle-gnome via an xsetting.

Please let me know what you'd like me to do to debug this.

Thanks.

--- Vladimir
