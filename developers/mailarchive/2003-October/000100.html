	If you use no --with-distro tag it uses the Ximian patch set [ this is
prolly what you want for maximum features ]. If you want to customize
your patch set you can use --with-distro=LunarLinux and edit
patches/OOO_1_1_0/apply to sub-set the patches for your particular
distro. If you're going to do that though; I suspect we're going to need
to expand how the patch sub-setting works currently to functionally
annotate the patches themselves and specify sub-sets differently since:

[ Debian, Ximian, Mdk, RedHat, LunarLinux ]

	is getting a bit unweildy; I suppose we should start doing functional
sub-setting ie.

[ GnomeVFS ]
[ Java ]

	or whatever, and have some map of requested tags.

&gt;<i> Now to make it work with our packaging scheme and I will include it with
</I>&gt;<i> my distro... yay another 12 hours compile time ! :)
</I>
	Right :-)

	Glad you found ooo-build helpful, looking forward to your patches :-)

	Regards,

		Michael.
