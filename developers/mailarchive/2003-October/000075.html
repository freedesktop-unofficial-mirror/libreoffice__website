<PRE>Hi Vladimir,

	Ok - it sounds as if (for reasons inscrutible) that for some reason VCL
is using the X servers' DPI setting in combination with the version it
gets from the Xsetting in some odd way ;-)

	Anyhow - there are _loads_ of ugly hacks in OO.o to screw with the DPI
setting; frequently there was code like:

	if (display_x &lt; 1024)
		DPI_X = 0.75;

	etc. ;-) we exorcised a lot of that mess in 1.0.3 - but possibly more
has crept in for 1.1.

	Anyway - the best way to fix the problem is to build OO.o :-) [ this
sounds frightening but is in fact quite easy ]. Simply wander across to:
<A HREF="http://ooo.ximian.com/packages/OOO_1_1_0,">http://ooo.ximian.com/packages/OOO_1_1_0,</A> download the latest
ooo-build-1.1.43.tar.gz, ./autogen.sh, ./download ; make ; sudo make
install and you can have a play about; when you get to that stage let me
know and I'll give you some pointers to the DPI code.

	FWIW you'll need ~4Gb+ of spare space, download 150Mb of code, and be
able to leave it running overnight ...

	It'd be great to have you digging into this with us; with a few simple
bits of debug we should be able to get much further,

	Regards,

		Michael.
