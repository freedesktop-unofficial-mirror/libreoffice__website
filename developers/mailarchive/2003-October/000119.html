	It's nice to be included in this sort of discussion; for sure.

	The plan so far; as decided on IRC is to merge them into the
cws_srx645_ooo111fix1 branch ASAP. Dan is working on the Java ones, and
I'll look at some of the other system-foo bits.

	The patches are in fact not that safe in the current setup - since the
Sun build system will not have SOLARJAVA set - thus we have to re-hash
all these patches so they 'fail-safe' such that when misc. new env-vars
that will not be set in the Sun build system are used, we tolerate / go
the right branch if they are not set. eg.

+.IF &quot;$(SOLAR_JAVA)&quot;!=&quot;&quot;
+
 SLOFILES= \
 	$(SLO)$/jni_info.obj		\
 	$(SLO)$/jni_data.obj		\
@@ -99,6 +101,8 @@
 .ENDIF
 .ENDIF
 
+.ENDIF # &quot;$(SOLAR_JAVA)&quot;!=&quot;&quot;
+

	is precisely wrong ;-) it has to be:

.IF &quot;$(SOLAR_JAVA)&quot; != &quot;YES&quot;

	or somesuch to be safe.

	Anyhow, Dan and I will re-hash this lot and get them in. Really
up-streaming is a matter of a little interest being shown by up-stream
people and some pain-reduction on the cws front. Anyhow - hopefully if
there is some sensible branch to commit to that we know of, we can get
some of this stuff merged up; the config stuff is by the most painful /
colliding bit we have to work with.

	Regards,

		Michael.
