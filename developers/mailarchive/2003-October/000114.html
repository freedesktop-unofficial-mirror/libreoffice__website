<PRE>Hi Anil,

	Great :-)

&gt;<i> Attached are the patches in diff format:
</I>
	Ok - it'd be great if you could concatenate all of these and append
them to patches/OOO_1_1/gui-symbol remove; you can do this by:

	cat foo-baa.diff &gt;&gt; gui-symbol-remove.diff    # (etc.)

	When you've done that write a suitable ChangeLog entry in the toplevel
and do a 'cvs commit' [ it's often worth doing a cvs diff -u in
openoffice/ first to make sure it's all looking good though ].

	I don't think it's a productive use of time to be finding more of these
and adding this code though :-)

&gt;<i> In case you want to checkin these patches, please feel free to do that.
</I>&gt;<i> Otherwise if you want me to checkin these, please let me know of your
</I>&gt;<i> approval. 
</I>
	Yes of course etc. :-)	

&gt;<i> As I was going through some of the src files, I found that some of the
</I>&gt;<i> images (e.g. one_left.bmp, all_left.bmp) are already being used in a
</I>&gt;<i> similar manner. 
</I>
	Right; my feeling is we should try to use Symbol where we can - since
it makes the resource files smaller.

&gt;<i> In case we go for the other mechanism of rendering images in source
</I>&gt;<i> rather than in src files, would all of these places require changes...?
</I>
	Yes; we'd want to switch them to use Symbol=Foo [ ie. the reverse of
what we're doing now ]. The problem is, each time we switch one of those
images we add ~24x24x4 bytes to the resource file = 2 1/2k so we don't
want to be doing it a lot.

&gt;<i> If yes, then current approach might be better as of now. 
</I>
	Sure, for now it's fine.

&gt;<i> Anyways, while I would be working on the current approach (fixing in
</I>&gt;<i> .src), I would still be interested to know the alternate approach. In
</I>&gt;<i> case you have some pointers on that, do let me know. 
</I>
	The alternative approach is documented in the bug; essentially you need
to change the code that renders that symbol. The code is in:

	vcl/source/window/decoview.cxx (ImplDrawSymbol)

	search for SYMBOL_ARROW_UP. We would need instead to understand how
that method is used / works, and have a single copy of the Up/Down (and
other ugly symbols) icons accessible from that code.

	To do that you'd need to add the icons to vcl/source/src/images.src,
giving them new SV_RESID_FOO_BAA type identifies defined in
vcl/inc/svids.hrc, and then add some code that did:

	BitmapEx aBmp(ResId( SV_RESID_FOO_BAA, 
		      Resource::GetResManager());
	pDev-&gt;DrawBitmapEx( Point( foo_X, baa_Y ), aBmp );

	or something similar.

	Also - it's best to CC all this sort of thing to the OO.o hackers list
for public interest / archival.

	Good work anyway :-)

	Thanks,

		Michael.
