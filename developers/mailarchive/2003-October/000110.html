	This looks cool;

	Thanks so much for digging into this in detail; unfortunately I'm in
India at the moment doing some OO.o / Mono evangelism so I can't play
with the patch yet which sucks - perhaps next Friday or so; - still it
looks great; this was a weight on my mind wrt. releasing 1.1 :-)

	The other problem is the JCA - have you (or preferably your employer)
signed it ? (<A HREF="http://www.openoffice.org/contributing[1]">http://www.openoffice.org/contributing[1]</A>), that's really a
pre-requisite for working on ooo-build actively I think,

	Great work,

		Michael.
