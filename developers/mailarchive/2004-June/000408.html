<PRE>Hi Kelly,

	So - with ooo-build we clobber the language setting ~totally; such that
we use only the result of the LANG, C_TYPE variables - which is the
standard unix way to do such things.

	More work there is required to support the few cases that require some
multi-lingual / mixed-language desktop; that work isn't done yet.

	Regards,

		Michael.
